# Create an Agent

Build agents that handle specific tasks within your agentic app.

---

## Prerequisites

- An existing agentic app
- At least one AI model configured with tool-calling support

---

## Create the Agent

### From the App Overview

1. Open your agentic app
2. In the **Agents** section, click **+ New Agent**
3. You'll be taken to the agent configuration page

---

## Configure Agent Profile

The profile establishes your agent's identity and operational parameters.

### Name

Choose a clear, descriptive name that reflects the agent's function.

```
Good                          Avoid
────                          ─────
Order Support Agent           Agent 1
Billing Assistant             Helper
Travel Booking Specialist     Bot
```

### Description

Write a description that helps the orchestrator understand when to route requests to this agent. Be specific about capabilities.

```markdown
# Good Description
Handles customer inquiries about order status, shipping updates,
delivery modifications, and order cancellations. Can look up orders
by order number, email, or phone number.

# Weak Description
Helps with orders.
```

### Avatar

Select a visual identifier for the agent. This appears in:

- The agent management interface
- Conversation logs and debugging views
- Customer-facing interfaces (if configured)

### AI Model

Choose the model that powers this agent's reasoning. Consider:

| Factor | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| Complex reasoning | GPT-4, Claude 3 Opus |
| Fast responses | GPT-3.5-turbo, Claude 3 Haiku |
| Code generation | GPT-4, specialized code models |
| Cost sensitivity | Smaller models for simple tasks |

### Context Window Limit

Set how many conversation messages the agent retains.

| Messages | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| 25 | Simple Q&A, transactional tasks |
| 50 | Standard conversations (default) |
| 100 | Multi-step processes |
| 200 | Complex, long-running workflows |

Higher limits provide more context but increase token usage.

## Define Agent Scope

The scope establishes boundaries for what tasks this agent handles.

### Writing Effective Scope

Be explicit about:

1. **What the agent does** — List specific capabilities
2. **What it doesn't do** — Clarify boundaries
3. **Handoff conditions** — When to transfer to other agents

```markdown
## Scope

### Responsibilities
- Check order status by order number, email, or phone
- Provide shipping updates and tracking information
- Process order modifications (address changes, item updates)
- Initiate cancellations for orders not yet shipped

### Out of Scope
- Payment processing and refunds (→ Billing Agent)
- Product recommendations (→ Sales Agent)
- Technical product support (→ Tech Support Agent)

### Escalation Triggers
- Customer requests to speak with a human
- Complaints about order quality
- Orders with value over $1000
```

---

## Write Instructions

Instructions define how the agent behaves and responds.

### Structure

```markdown
## Role
You are [role description]. Your primary goal is [objective].

## Guidelines
- [Behavioral guideline 1]
- [Behavioral guideline 2]
- [Behavioral guideline 3]

## Response Format
[How to structure responses]

## Constraints
- [What not to do]
- [Limitations to enforce]
```

### Example Instructions

```markdown
## Role
You are a friendly and efficient order support specialist. Your goal
is to help customers quickly resolve order-related questions.

## Guidelines
- Greet customers warmly but briefly
- Always verify the order number before providing details
- Provide clear, actionable next steps
- If you can't resolve an issue, offer alternatives

## Response Format
- Keep responses concise (2-4 sentences for simple queries)
- Use bullet points for multiple items
- Include relevant order details when discussing specific orders

## Constraints
- Never share payment details beyond last 4 digits
- Don't promise specific delivery dates unless confirmed by tracking
- Don't process cancellations for shipped orders without manager approval
```

---

## Add Tools

Tools enable your agent to take actions and retrieve data.

### Adding Tools

1. In the agent configuration, navigate to **Tools**
2. Click **+ Add Tool**
3. Choose to:
   - **Create new** — Build a tool specific to this agent
   - **Import existing** — Use a tool from the tools library

### Tool Configuration

For each tool, ensure:

- **Name** is descriptive and unique
- **Description** clearly explains what it does (the LLM uses this)
- **Parameters** are well-documented with types and examples

```yaml
name: get_order_status
description: |
  Retrieves the current status of a customer order including
  shipping details, estimated delivery, and tracking number.

parameters:
  order_id:
    type: string
    description: The unique order identifier (e.g., ORD-12345)
    required: true
```

## Connect Knowledge

Link knowledge sources for RAG-powered responses.

### Adding Knowledge

1. Navigate to **Knowledge** in agent configuration
2. Click **+ Connect Knowledge**
3. Select a Search AI application or create a new one

### Knowledge Sources

| Source | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| Documents | Policies, guides, FAQs |
| Web crawler | Website content, help centers |
| Confluence | Internal documentation |
| SharePoint | Enterprise content |
| Custom API | Dynamic data sources |

---

## Test the Agent

Validate your agent before deployment.

### Test Conversations

1. Click **Test** in the agent toolbar
2. Simulate user conversations
3. Verify:
   - Correct tool selection
   - Appropriate knowledge retrieval
   - Response quality and tone

### Test Cases to Cover

```markdown
## Happy Path
- Standard order status inquiry
- Successful modification request

## Edge Cases
- Invalid order number
- Order not found
- Multiple orders matching criteria

## Error Handling
- Tool failure scenarios
- Missing required information

## Boundaries
- Requests outside scope
- Escalation triggers
```

---

## Save and Deploy

1. Click **Save** to preserve your configuration
2. Run **Diagnostics** to validate all dependencies
3. **Publish** your app to make the agent live
