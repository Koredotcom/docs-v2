# Quickstart

Create your first AI agent and agentic app.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- An Agent Platform account
- An AI model with tool-calling capabilities configured (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or Azure)

---

## Create an Agentic App

An agentic app is the container for your agents, tools, and orchestration logic.

### Step 1: Create the App

1. Navigate to **Autonomous Agents** in the sidebar
2. Click **+ New App**
3. Configure your app:

```yaml
Name: Customer Support Bot
Description: Handles customer inquiries about orders, returns, and products
AI Model: gpt-4o
```

4. Click **Create App**

Your app is created with a default orchestrator that will route requests to your agents.

---

## Add an Agent

Agents are specialized workers that handle specific types of tasks.

### Step 2: Create Your First Agent

1. From your app's overview, click **+ New Agent**
2. Configure the agent profile:

```yaml
Name: Order Assistant
Description: Helps customers check order status, track shipments, and process returns
AI Model: gpt-4o
Context Window: 50 messages
```

3. Define the agent's scope and instructions:

```markdown
## Scope
You help customers with order-related inquiries including:
- Order status checks
- Shipment tracking
- Return requests
- Order modifications

## Instructions
- Always verify the customer's order number before providing details
- Be concise but friendly
- If you cannot resolve an issue, offer to escalate to a human agent
- Never share sensitive payment information
```

4. Click **Save**

---

## Add a Tool

Tools enable agents to take actions and retrieve data.

### Step 3: Create a Workflow Tool

1. From your agent's page, click **+ Add Tool**
2. Select **New Workflow Tool**
3. Configure the tool:

```yaml
Name: Get Order Status
Description: Retrieves the current status of a customer order by order ID
```

4. Build the workflow:
   - Add a **Start** node
   - Add an **API Call** node to fetch order data
   - Add an **End** node to return the response

5. Define the input parameters:

```json
{
  "order_id": {
    "type": "string",
    "description": "The unique order identifier",
    "required": true
  }
}
```

6. Click **Deploy**

---

## Test Your Agent

### Step 4: Run a Test Conversation

1. Click the **Test** button in the top right
2. Start a conversation:

```
You: What's the status of order #12345?

Agent: I'll check that for you.

[Tool Call: Get Order Status]

Your order #12345 is currently "Shipped" and is expected
to arrive on March 15th. The tracking number is 1Z999AA10123456784.

Would you like me to help with anything else?
```

## Deploy

### Step 5: Publish Your App

1. Click **Publish** in the app settings
2. Select your deployment channels:
   - Web Widget
   - API Endpoint
   - Slack
   - Microsoft Teams
3. Configure channel-specific settings
4. Click **Deploy**

Your agent is now live and ready to handle customer inquiries.
