# Introduction to AI for Process

Enterprises may have automated individual tasks, but operational bottlenecks persist in complex, cross-functional processes such as onboarding, procure-to-pay, customer claims, and IT operations. These workflows depend on unstructured data, business judgment, and constant exceptions—areas where traditional automation fails.

AI for Process addresses these challenges by combining AI reasoning, system integration, and process automation into a unified platform. It enables agentic automation that understands inputs, reasons through decisions, coordinates across systems and teams, and autonomously achieves business outcomes. AI for Process connects business intent, intelligence, and execution, orchestrating entire workflows to achieve desired outcomes.


## Key Capabilities

AI for Process enables enterprise automation through integrated capabilities that transform how businesses design, execute, and optimize their processes.

#### Process Automation

The platform provides visual, no-code workflow orchestration for creating agent-powered workflows with adaptive process sequencing across teams and systems. Workflows can be triggered automatically from email, system events, schedules, and API calls without manual handoffs. Strategic human-in-the-loop checkpoints enable approval and exception handling, with embedded user-input forms for validation and decision-making at critical points.

#### Intelligence and Data

Document intelligence capabilities automate the processing of unstructured inputs, including invoices, forms, claims, and documents. Deep integration with Agent Platform and Agentic Apps enables multi-agent reasoning for complex problem-solving. Memory and context management enable agents to retain information across interactions, enabling personalized, continuous process handling.

#### Integration and Infrastructure

The platform connects to over 250 pre-built integrations across ERP, CRM, and ITSM systems without replacing existing infrastructure. Multi-model support enables the deployment of commercial models from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, as well as fine-tuned and open-source options via HuggingFace. Cloud-agnostic architecture operates seamlessly across AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, on-premise, or hybrid environments.

#### Observability and Governance

Real-time analytics monitor agent performance, execution metrics, token usage, and resource consumption across models. Complete audit logging maintains time-stamped records of all system activities for security and compliance traceability. Security controls include role-based access control, automated PII masking, data anonymization, and compliance checkpoints throughout workflows.
