# Create a Workflow

You can create a new workflow to leverage models, build flows, and later deploy it as an endpoint. You can start the workflow creation journey from the Workflows page. The page also allows you to manage your existing workflows and view the workflows that have been shared with you by others.

Steps to create a Workflow:

1. Log in to your account.  
1. On the **Workflows** page, select **Create new workflow**. The **New workflow** dialog box is displayed.
