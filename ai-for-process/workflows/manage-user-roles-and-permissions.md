# Manage User Roles and Permissions

Account owners can invite users to collaborate on specific workflows. Invited users can access the Models and Data modules for the invited account but can only see the workflows they're invited to. 

!!! note

    You can only invite those users to an app, who have access to your account.

Steps to invite users to your Workflow:

1. Log in → AI for Process.
2. Click the **Workflows** tab on the top navigation bar, and select the required Workflow.
3. Click **Sharing & Permission** in the left navigation bar. The page lists the existing collaborators, if any.
