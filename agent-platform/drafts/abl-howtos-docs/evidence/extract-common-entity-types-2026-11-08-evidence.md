# Evidence: extract-common-entity-types

**Date:** 2026-11-08
**Topic:** 7.4 - How to extract dates, numbers, locations, and free text
**Draft:** `agent-platform/drafts/abl-howtos-docs/reviews/extract-common-entity-types-2026-11-08-draft.md`
**Release:** `hotfix_Artemis_1.9.2` (code repo read-only, branch head `cf1f637c7ed`)
**Workflow:** New article. No prior draft or evidence.

## Validation harness

`validateABL` from `packages/compiler/src/platform/ir/validate-ir.ts` bundled with esbuild into `scratchpad/h/validate.mjs` (zod pin check disabled, database and mongoose stubbed, helper packages installed in the scratch folder). The scratchpad was reset once during this run and the harness was rebuilt. Command: `node validate.mjs <file>...`. Research agents also ran an IR dumper and regex module tests before the reset. The runtime was not started. Runtime claims come from source reading.

## Scenario and variant map

| Scenario or variant | Supported? | Evidence | Article coverage |
| ------------------- | ---------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| Type table and normalization | yes | itn.ts; extraction-validation 255-480 | covered |
| Dates: ISO output, relative phrases | yes | chrono; temporal-date.ts | covered |
| `temporal` future, past, any | yes | temporal-date 52-80 | covered |
| Currency drops the code | yes | extraction-validation ~150 | covered |
| Spoken number reading depends on a numeric field | yes | input-normalization 19-26, 128-150 | covered |
| Location and free_text pass-through | yes | intrinsic-validation | covered |
| Boolean accepted phrases | yes | extraction-validation | covered |
| Phone E.164 and locale country | yes | extraction-validation | covered |
| `components` guides model only | yes | stage-llm 684-693 | covered |
| Datetime time part output | yes, date only (resolved) | `itn.ts` 223 and `extraction-validation.ts` 426 treat `datetime` like `date`; `normalizeDate` passes through values that start with `YYYY-MM-DD`, else chrono via `extractDatesFromText`, whose `toISODate` returns `YYYY-MM-DD` only (date-extraction.ts 164-185); else `Date.parse` passthrough | covered |
| Reason codes | yes | gather-rejection-reasons | covered |

**Gate result:** pass

## Red-team coverage pass

| Question | Result | Evidence or correction |
| -------- | ------ | ---------------------- |
| Did I inspect parser, type, compiler, runtime, tests, and examples? | pass | See source table. |
| Did I search synonyms and neighboring constructs? | pass | Searched entity, intent, NLU, sub-intent, digression, lexical, classifier, and pipeline terms. |
| Did I identify every authoring style, shorthand, alias, default, and fallback? | pass | Variant map rows. |
| Did I distinguish optional helpers from required configuration? | pass | Stated per row. |
| Did I avoid making a preferred pattern sound like the only pattern? | pass | Alternatives stated. |
| Could a customer build the scenario another supported way? | pass | Linked or covered. |
| If asked 'are you not considering all scenarios?', what evidence would I show? | pass | The variant map. |

**Coverage verdict:** pass

## Persona simulation review

| Persona | Verdict | Strengths | Required improvements |
| ------- | ------- | --------- | --------------------- |
| Senior platform architect | ready | Behavior matches code reads and harness runs. | Run live traces. |
| Senior content writer | ready | Scannable tables and short sentences. | none |
| Product manager/customer enablement | ready | Clear limits stated up front. | none |

## Known gaps and notes

- Resolved: `datetime` returns the date only for natural language. Pass-through values keep what the customer typed.
