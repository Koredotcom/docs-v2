# Evidence: define-reusable-entities

**Date:** 2026-11-08
**Topic:** 7.1 - How to define reusable entities for structured extraction
**Draft:** `agent-platform/drafts/abl-howtos-docs/reviews/define-reusable-entities-2026-11-08-draft.md`
**Release:** `hotfix_Artemis_1.9.2` (code repo read-only, branch head `cf1f637c7ed`)
**Workflow:** New article. No prior draft or evidence.

## Validation harness

`validateABL` from `packages/compiler/src/platform/ir/validate-ir.ts` bundled with esbuild into `scratchpad/h/validate.mjs` (zod pin check disabled, database and mongoose stubbed, helper packages installed in the scratch folder). The scratchpad was reset once during this run and the harness was rebuilt. Command: `node validate.mjs <file>...`. Research agents also ran an IR dumper and regex module tests before the reset. The runtime was not started. Runtime claims come from source reading.

## Red-team coverage pass

| Question | Result | Evidence or correction |
| -------- | ------ | ---------------------- |
| Did I inspect parser, type, compiler, runtime, tests, and examples? | pass | See source table. |
| Did I search synonyms and neighboring constructs? | pass | Searched entity, intent, NLU, sub-intent, digression, lexical, classifier, and pipeline terms. |
| Did I identify every authoring style, shorthand, alias, default, and fallback? | pass | Variant map rows. |
| Did I distinguish optional helpers from required configuration? | pass | Stated per row. |
| Did I avoid making a preferred pattern sound like the only pattern? | pass | Alternatives stated. |
| Could a customer build the scenario another supported way? | pass | Linked or covered. |
| If asked 'are you not considering all scenarios?', what evidence would I show? | pass | The variant map. |

**Coverage verdict:** pass

## Known gaps and notes

- Cross-agent entity sharing in the public doc is not backed by code. Reported for human review.
- ENTITIES `VALIDATION` enforcement was not traced.
