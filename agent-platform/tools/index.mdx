# Tools

Enable agents to interact with external systems and perform actions.

---

## Overview

Tools are capabilities that empower agents to go beyond conversation—they can retrieve data, execute logic, trigger workflows, and interact with third-party services.

When an agent needs to take action, it:

1. Identifies the appropriate tool based on the task
2. Prepares the required parameters
3. Invokes the tool through the platform
4. Processes the results
5. Incorporates the output into its response

## Tool Types

<div class="cards">

### [Workflow Tools](/docs/tools/workflow)
Visual, no-code tools built with drag-and-drop. Best for well-defined, traceable processes.

### [Code Tools](/docs/tools/code)
Custom JavaScript or Python functions. Best for complex logic and dynamic processing.

### [MCP Tools](/docs/tools/mcp)
Remote functions via Model Context Protocol. Best for enterprise integrations and shared toolsets.

## Quick Comparison

| Aspect | Workflow | Code | MCP |
|--------|----------|------|-----|
| Interface | Visual builder | Code editor | Server config |
| Languages | No-code | JS, Python | Protocol-based |
| Best for | Defined processes | Custom logic | External services |
| Deployment | API endpoint | Inline execution | Remote server |
| Skill level | Low | Medium-High | Medium |

## How Tool Calling Works

```
User: "What's the weather in Tokyo?"

1. Agent receives request
   └─ Identifies need for external data

2. Tool selection
   └─ Matches "weather" to get_weather tool

3. Parameter preparation
   └─ Extracts: { "location": "Tokyo" }

4. Tool invocation
   └─ Platform calls the tool API

5. Execution
   └─ Tool fetches weather data

6. Result processing
   └─ Returns: { "temp": 22, "condition": "Sunny" }

7. Response generation
   └─ Agent: "It's currently 22°C and sunny in Tokyo."
```

## Tool Anatomy

Every tool has these components:

### Name
A unique identifier used in tool selection.

```yaml
name: get_order_status
```

### Description
Explains what the tool does. The LLM uses this to decide when to invoke it.

```yaml
description: |
  Retrieves the current status of a customer order including
  shipping information, estimated delivery date, and tracking number.
  Use when customers ask about their order status.
```

### Parameters
The inputs the tool accepts.

```yaml
parameters:
  order_id:
    type: string
    description: The unique order identifier (e.g., ORD-12345)
    required: true

  include_history:
    type: boolean
    description: Whether to include status change history
    required: false
    default: false
```

### Output
What the tool returns.

```yaml
output:
  type: object
  properties:
    status:
      type: string
      enum: [pending, processing, shipped, delivered, cancelled]
    tracking_number:
      type: string
    estimated_delivery:
      type: string
      format: date
```

## Creating Tools

### Option 1: Create New

Build a tool from scratch for your specific needs.

1. Navigate to **Tools** in your app or the tools library
2. Click **+ New Tool**
3. Select tool type (Workflow, Code, or MCP)
4. Configure name, description, and parameters
5. Build the tool logic
6. Test and deploy

### Option 2: Import Existing

Reuse tools from the library or import from files.

1. Click **Import Tool**
2. Upload a `.zip` file containing:
   - `flow_definition.json` (required)
   - `app_definition.json` (optional)
   - `env_variables.json` (optional)
3. Review and configure
4. Deploy

---

## Tool Scopes

### Library Tools

Created in the **Tools** section, independent of any app.

- Reusable across multiple apps
- Changes affect all linked apps
- Best for shared functionality

### App-Scoped Tools

Created within a specific **Agentic App**.

- Isolated to that app
- Changes don't affect library versions
- Best for app-specific logic

---

## Linking Tools to Agents

1. Open your agent configuration
2. Navigate to **Tools**
3. Click **+ Add Tool**
4. Choose:
   - **Create new** — Build app-specific tool
   - **Link existing** — Connect library tool
   - **Import** — Upload tool definition
5. Configure tool access and permissions

---

## Execution Modes

### Synchronous

Tool executes immediately, agent waits for response.

```
Request → Execute → Response → Continue
```

**Use for**: Real-time lookups, quick calculations, instant validations.

### Asynchronous

Tool executes in background, agent continues or waits for callback.

```
Request → Queue → (Agent continues) → Callback → Update
```

**Use for**: Long-running processes, batch operations, external approvals.

---

## Deployment

After building a tool, deploy it to make it available.

### Sync Endpoint

```
POST /api/v1/tools/{tool_id}/execute
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "parameters": {
    "order_id": "ORD-12345"
  }
}
```

### Async Poll Endpoint

```
POST /api/v1/tools/{tool_id}/execute/async
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "parameters": {
    "order_id": "ORD-12345"
  }
}

Response:
{
  "execution_id": "exec_abc123",
  "status": "pending"
}

GET /api/v1/tools/{tool_id}/executions/{execution_id}
```

### Async Push (Webhook)

Configure a webhook URL to receive results when ready.

---

## Security

### API Keys

Tools are secured with API keys for external access.

```yaml
headers:
  Authorization: Bearer sk-tool-xxxxx
```

### Role-Based Access

Control who can:

- View tool configurations
- Edit tool logic
- Deploy tools
- Access execution logs

### PII Protection

Tools inherit app-level PII protection:

- Input scanning for sensitive patterns
- Automatic masking in logs
- Secure internal access when needed

---

## Testing Tools

Before deployment, validate tool behavior:

1. Open the tool details page
2. Click **Test**
3. Provide sample input parameters
4. Review execution results
5. Check for errors and edge cases

---

## Monitoring

Track tool performance with:

- **Execution history** — Success/failure rates
- **Response times** — Latency metrics
- **Token usage** — For AI-powered tools
- **Audit logs** — Who changed what, when
