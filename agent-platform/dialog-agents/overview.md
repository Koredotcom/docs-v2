# About Dialog Agents

The Agent Platform supports two distinct paradigms for building intelligent AI applications:
Dialog Agents (Orchestrated Autonomy, Structured Flow Approach) and AI Agents (Full Autonomy, Reasoning-Driven Approach).

Dialog Agents paradigm, powered by DialogGPT and Agent Node, offers a structured flow approach to enable a dynamic conversational experience. While responses are still somewhat deterministic, Dialog Agents can adapt to variations in input, handle multi-turn interactions with greater ease, recognize user intent, extract key information autonomously, and leverage context across conversations. This results in a more responsive and interactive AI that can assist users intelligently within defined boundaries. [Learn more](./dialoggpt.md).
