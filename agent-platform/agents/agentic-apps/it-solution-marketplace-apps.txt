# AI for IT Apps in Marketplace

The Agent Platform is an enterprise-grade multi-agent orchestration solution for developing, deploying, and managing AI business applications. It features two paradigms: Dialog Agents for structured flows and AI Agents for autonomous reasoning. The platform integrates Search/RAG, AI Safety, and a Marketplace of pre-built components. 

Marketplace apps are ready-to-use business solutions, templates, and tools that enhance and automate workflows. They adopt an agentic approach specifically for human-like conversation. The apps provision supervisors, specialized agents, and tools to execute domain-specific tasks.
