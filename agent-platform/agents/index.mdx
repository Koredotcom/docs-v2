# Agents

Agents are the autonomous workers that power your agentic apps.

---

## Overview

An agent is a specialized AI entity with:

- A defined **scope** of responsibilities
- **Instructions** that guide behavior
- Access to **tools** for taking actions
- Connected **knowledge** for context

The orchestrator routes user requests to the most appropriate agent based on their descriptions and capabilities.

```

### 1. Create
Define the agent's identity, scope, and purpose.

### 2. Configure
Add instructions, connect tools, and link knowledge sources.

### 3. Test
Validate behavior with test conversations and edge cases.

### 4. Validate
Run diagnostics to ensure all dependencies are properly configured.

### 5. Deploy
Publish the agent as part of your agentic app.

### 6. Monitor
Track performance, review conversations, and iterate.

## Agent Types by Use Case

### Customer Service Agents
Handle inquiries, process requests, and resolve issues.

```yaml
scope: Order tracking, returns, product questions
tools: CRM lookup, order management, ticketing
knowledge: FAQs, product docs, policies
```

### Sales Agents
Qualify leads, answer questions, and guide purchases.

```yaml
scope: Product recommendations, pricing, checkout assistance
tools: Product search, cart management, payment processing
knowledge: Product catalog, pricing, promotions
```

### HR/Employee Agents
Support internal employees with HR and IT tasks.

```yaml
scope: Leave requests, benefits, IT support
tools: HR systems, ticket creation, knowledge search
knowledge: HR policies, IT guides, company wiki
```

### Process Agents
Execute business workflows and automate tasks.

```yaml
scope: Document processing, approvals, data entry
tools: Document extraction, workflow triggers, database updates
knowledge: Process documentation, compliance rules
```

## Key Concepts

### Agent Selection

The orchestrator selects agents based on:

1. **Description matching**: How well the agent's description matches user intent
2. **Scope alignment**: Whether the task falls within the agent's defined scope
3. **Tool availability**: Whether the agent has tools needed for the task

Write clear, specific descriptions to improve selection accuracy.

### Agent Handoffs

Agents can transfer control to other agents when:

- The task falls outside their scope
- A specialized agent is better suited
- The user explicitly requests a different capability

Handoffs preserve conversation context so users don't need to repeat information.

### Stateless Execution

Each agent interaction is stateless by default. Agents receive:

- The conversation history (within context window)
- User profile data (if configured)
- Tool and knowledge access

They do not retain memory between conversations unless explicitly designed to do so.
