# Configure a Workflow

You can modify your workflow's general details, such as its name and description, asynchronous configuration, and environment variables. You can also undeploy, and delete the workflow if it's not in use.

## Sync/Async Mode Setup

You can set the sync/async mode configuration for the workflow endpoint. If you change the mode, you must redeploy the workflow. The key difference is that synchronous mode blocks the client until the response is received, while asynchronous mode allows the client to continue working while the integration processes the request.

Steps to enable and configure the asynchronous mode:

1. Log in → In AI for Process Modules top menu → Click **Workflows**.
2. Select the workflow to modify its configuration. The Workflow page is displayed.
3. Click **Configurations** in the left navigation and then click **Setup sync/async**.

4. The Sync/Async mode setup pop-up displays with async mode disabled by default.
    * **Synchronous mode timeout**: The allowed range is 60 to 300 seconds (5 minutes). The default is 180 Seconds (3 minutes). The endpoint will trigger a timeout error if the request is not completed within the selected time frame.

    * **Asynchronous mode configuration**: Turn on the **Enable async** toggle and do the following:

        1. Provide the URL of your external application to which messages are to be delivered. 
        2. Enter the access token generated by the external application.
        3. Set the Asynchronous mode timeout duration: 
            * **Set timeout**: The allowed timeout range is 60 seconds to 600 seconds (10 minutes). The default is 180 Seconds (3 minutes). 
            * **No timeout**: This allows the workflow to process the request without a time limit.

        4. Click **Save**.

    !!! note 

        Timeout precedence: Workflow timeout > Node timeout > Model timeout.

4. If you have changed the mode, you must redeploy the workflow: Go to **Workflow endpoint** in the left navigation and click the **Deploy** button on the top-right corner of the page.

## Manage Environment Variables

You can define reusable values and configurations for the workflow using Environment variables. Those values
can be used by different nodes in the workflow flow.

### Add an Environment Variable

Steps to add an environment variable:

1. On the **Workflow** tab, select the workflow you want to modify the details. The Workflow page is displayed.

2. Click **Configurations** in the left navigation and then select **Manage environment variables**.

3. The **Create environment variable** dialog box is displayed. Click **Add** or **Add variable**.

4. Specify the following information on the **Add variable** dialog box:

    * **Variable name**: Provide a descriptive name for the variable.
    * **Secure variable**: Use the toggle to enable security for the variable. (If you are enabling the security, read the onscreen information carefully to understand the impact.)
    * **Value**: Enter the desired value for the variable.
    * **Notes** (optional): Enter any notes about how the variable should be used or its purpose.

5. Click **Save**. The created variable is listed on the **Create environment variable** dialog box.



### Edit or Delete an Environment Variable

Click the three dots icon corresponding to the Name of the variable to edit the details of the variable or Delete to delete a variable.

## Undeploy the Workflow

You can undeploy the workflow if it's no longer in use. Undeploying the workflow will result in an immediate disconnection from all active instances. Click **Proceed to undeploy** on the Configurations page and follow the on-screen instructions.

## Delete the Workflow

You can delete an undeployed workflow. Deleting the workflow will remove all the associated data. Click **Proceed to delete** on the Configurations page and follow the on-screen instructions.
