# Accessing AI for Work

Admins configure [user enrollments](../user-management/user-enrollments.md) to let users log in to the Platform at [https://work.kore.ai/login/](https://work.kore.ai/login/).

Admins can also let users log in using the following methods:

* Use Google Workspace or Microsoft Office profiles.
* Use the organization's login after they configure [Single Sign-on](../security/sso-overview.md).

We support the latest versions of Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari, and Mozilla Firefox browsers.
