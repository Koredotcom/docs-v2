# Custom Agents

Build AI agents tailored to your organization's specific needs.

---

## Overview

Custom agents allow you to create AI-powered assistants with:

- **Custom instructions** — Define how the agent responds
- **Enterprise knowledge** — Connect internal data sources
- **Tool integrations** — Access external systems and APIs
- **Configurable behavior** — Control tone, scope, and capabilities

---

## Agent Types

  - Request/response mapping
```

**Best for:** Real-time data access, triggering external actions

### Search Agent

RAG-based retrieval from connected knowledge sources.

```yaml
Type: Search Agent

Configuration:
  - Knowledge source connections
  - Retrieval settings
  - Answer generation model
```

**Best for:** Finding information in documents, knowledge bases

### Agentic Flow Agent

Multi-step workflows with decision logic.

```yaml
Type: Agentic Flow Agent

Configuration:
  - Flow definition with nodes
  - Conditional branching
  - Human-in-the-loop steps
```

**Best for:** Guided processes, multi-step automation

### Autonomous Agent

Self-directed agent that completes tasks independently.

```yaml
Type: Autonomous Agent
Use Case: Research, analysis, complex automation

Configuration:
  - Goal definition
  - Available tools
  - Guardrails and limits
```

**Best for:** Open-ended tasks, research, comprehensive analysis

### Bot Agent

Conversational dialog with structured flows.

```yaml
Type: Bot Agent
Use Case: Guided interactions, forms, structured data collection

Configuration:
  - Dialog flows
  - Entity extraction
  - Fallback handling
```

**Best for:** Form filling, guided workflows, structured conversations

### Workflow Agent

Visual workflow automation.

```yaml
Type: Workflow Agent
Use Case: Business process automation

Configuration:
  - Visual workflow builder
  - Integration nodes
  - Trigger conditions
```

**Best for:** Automating repetitive business processes

### MCP Agent

Model Context Protocol integrations for external tools.

```yaml
Type: MCP Agent
Use Case: External tool connections, third-party integrations

Configuration:
  - MCP server connections
  - Tool selection
  - Permission scoping
```

**Best for:** Connecting to external systems via MCP protocol

## Create a Custom Agent

### Step 1: Start Creation

1. Navigate to **Custom Agents**
2. Click **Create Agent**
3. Select the agent type

### Step 2: Configure Basics

```yaml
Name: "Engineering Assistant"
Description: "Helps engineers find documentation and answer technical questions"
Icon: Select or upload
```

### Step 3: Set Instructions

Write clear instructions that define agent behavior:

```
You are an engineering assistant for the platform team.

Your responsibilities:
- Answer questions about our codebase and architecture
- Help find relevant documentation
- Explain technical concepts clearly

Guidelines:
- Be concise and technical
- Include code examples when helpful
- Cite documentation sources
- Escalate unclear issues to the team lead
```

### Step 4: Connect Knowledge

Add enterprise knowledge sources:

| Source Type | Examples |
|-------------|----------|
| **Search AI** | Confluence, SharePoint, Google Drive |
| **Agentic Apps** | Agent Platform applications |
| **Amazon Q** | AWS-based knowledge |

Configuration:
1. Click **Add Knowledge Source**
2. Select connector type
3. Authenticate and configure
4. Set retrieval parameters

### Step 5: Add Tools (Optional)

Connect external tools and APIs:

```yaml
Tools:
  - jira_integration:
      description: "Create and search Jira tickets"
  - github_api:
      description: "Search code and create issues"
  - calendar_tool:
      description: "Check availability and schedule meetings"
```

### Step 6: Test and Deploy

1. Use the **Preview** panel to test conversations
2. Iterate on instructions and configuration
3. Deploy to selected channels
4. Monitor performance in Analytics

## Enterprise Knowledge

### Search AI Connector

Connect to Search AI for RAG-based retrieval:

1. Navigate to **Enterprise Knowledge** → **Search AI**
2. Select your Search AI application
3. Configure retrieval settings:
   - **Top K results** — Number of chunks to retrieve
   - **Similarity threshold** — Minimum relevance score
   - **Source filtering** — Limit to specific content sources

### Agentic Apps Connector

Use Agent Platform apps as knowledge sources:

1. Navigate to **Enterprise Knowledge** → **Agentic Apps**
2. Select the agentic app to connect
3. Configure access permissions

### Amazon Q Connector

Connect Amazon Q for AWS-based knowledge:

1. Navigate to **Enterprise Knowledge** → **Amazon Q**
2. Configure AWS credentials
3. Select Amazon Q application
4. Set access permissions

## Agent Management

### Versioning

Track changes to agent configurations:

- View version history
- Compare versions
- Roll back to previous versions
- Tag versions for releases

### Access Control

Configure who can access and modify agents:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full control, delete |
| **Editor** | Modify configuration |
| **Viewer** | View only |
| **User** | Interact with deployed agent |

### Monitoring

Track agent performance:

- Conversation volume
- Response quality metrics
- Error rates
- User satisfaction

---

## Best Practices

### Instructions

- Be specific about agent scope and limitations
- Include examples of good responses
- Define escalation paths for edge cases
- Specify tone and communication style

### Knowledge

- Keep knowledge sources up to date
- Use specific source filtering for accuracy
- Test retrieval quality regularly
- Monitor for outdated information

### Testing
