# Create an Agent from Marketplace

The Marketplace is a centralized hub for discovering and deploying pre-built AI agents, tools, and templates. It enables faster agent development by allowing users to import ready-made components instead of building agents from scratch. The Marketplace supports both apps and agents, making it ideal for rapid prototyping and quick experimentation.

## When to Use the Marketplace

Creating an agent from the Marketplace is recommended when you want to:

* Quickly prototype or validate use cases.
* Reuse pre-configured agents with predefined tools and workflows.
* Reduce setup time without writing custom logic.
