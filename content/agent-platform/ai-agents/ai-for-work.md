AI for Work is an enterprise platform that integrates AI to optimize productivity. It unifies information access, automates workflows, and enhances knowledge work. This addresses information fragmentation, manual inefficiencies, and AI accessibility, leading to improved operational efficiency and allowing employees to focus on high-value tasks.

The Platform offers comprehensive end-to-end development, deployment, and advanced multi-agent orchestration for scalable Agentic applications at the enterprise level. It works seamlessly with AI for Work, allowing organizations to quickly deploy intelligent service solutions that leverage conversation optimization and multi-agent orchestration. This integration enhances customer satisfaction and reduces operational costs.

## Prerequisites

* AI for Work and the Platform applications must exist in the same workspace.
* You must have administrator access to AI for Work.

## Create Workflow Agents and Autonomous Agents in AI for Work

Powered by the Platform, AI for Work enables the development of two distinct agent types: Workflow Agents and Autonomous Agents.

## Agent Types

**Workflow Agent:** Workflow Agents in AI for Work leverage capabilities from the Platform to deliver precise, contextually relevant responses to user queries in real-time. This streamlined approach simplifies the creation of intelligent agents, enabling the rapid deployment of business solutions. <a href="https://docs.kore.ai/ai-for-work/custom-agents/workflow-agents/">Learn more about Workflow Agents.</a>

**Autonomous Agent:** Autonomous Agents leverage the Platform to manage complex business tasks and workflows independently. These AI-powered agents utilize adaptive algorithms for dynamic decision-making, responding to evolving business requirements in real-time. <a href="https://docs.kore.ai/ai-for-work/custom-agents/autonomous-agent/">Learn more about Autonomous Agents.</a>
