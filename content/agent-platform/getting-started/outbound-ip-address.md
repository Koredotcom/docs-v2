# Agent Platform Outbound IP Addresses

The Platform makes outbound requests from a fixed set of IP addresses. If your systems or third-party services enforce IP allowlisting, you must add these IPs to your firewall or network's allowlist. This action ensures that traffic originating from the Platform is recognized and permitted by your network or external service endpoints.

Outbound IP Addresses (SaaS instance: [https://agent-platform.kore.ai](https://agent-platform.kore.ai)):
