## Using Workspace

**Workspaces** are a way to organize people productively, while everyone is part of your wider team of AI Agent developers. When setting your account, if you choose to use SSO, then the Platform creates workspaces.

Team members can join one or multiple Workspaces, or they can create their own. It’s easy to browse Workspaces within the same organization and to switch between them. Here is how it works.

Some common scenarios where you can join or sign up to a workspace include the following:

* If a user invites you to join their workspace.
* If your enterprise administrator adds you to your enterprise workspace through SSO or API.
* If you use a business email address to sign up, you can join any other workspace that matches your email domain. In such cases, the system only creates a User identity for you and adds you to the selected workspace.
* If you sign up using Single Sign-On (SSO) options like Google Workspace or Microsoft Office 365, the Platform uses your email domain as the Workspace name. For example, if your email address is `john.doe@example.com`, the Platform creates your workspace as `example.com`. You can change the Workspace name from the Profile menu.
* If you sign up using the email address verification option, you can define your workspace name during sign up.
* If you are the first user of a workspace, that is, if you have created the workspace, you become the Workspace Owner. The workspace’s unique identifier is the email address of its owner.
* Use the 'Invite Team' option to invite more users. You can also invite users to a specific assistant. A user can be part of multiple workspaces.

### Join a Workspace

Before setting up your Workspace, sign up on the Platform.

If your email domain matches an existing Workspace within the Platform, then it means that your organization is working on projects you may want to join. The Platform lists matching Workspaces and you can **Request Access** to them when you sign up. If you are part of a team, but you aren't managing it, then this is the recommended way to proceed.

### Create Your Workspace

If you are managing a team, as part of your organization’s AI Agent development projects, then you may want to create your own Workspace. You can do so by choosing **Create New**, rather than requesting access to an existing Workspace.

<img src="../images/accplatform(3).png" alt="image_tooltip" title="image_tooltip" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">

To create your Workspace, provide a **Name**, and invite the first members by entering their email addresses. After accepting your invitation, invitees get access to your Workspace.

### Invite Members to your Workspace

After creating the Workspace, Administrators can invite new members to their workspace.

Steps to invite users:

1. Select the **Invite** option from the top navigation menu on the Platform Landing Page.  
    <img src="../images/accplatform(15).png" alt="image_tooltip" title="image_tooltip" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">

3. Select **Invite**. The invited users receive an invitation email.
4. When the invited user accepts the invitation, they can access the workspace.

!!! note

### Switch Workspaces

Team members can switch workspaces, using the switcher in the upper-right corner.
