# DialogGPT

DialogGPT is an intelligent, agentic orchestration engine that powers natural conversations at scale, providing autonomous orchestration across multiple topics through Dialog Tasks. This innovative solution perfectly balances defined business rules and the conversational fluidity your customers expect from an AI Agents. Using a powerful combination of text embeddings and generative models, it contextually understands user input and identifies optimal paths for request fulfillment. Setup is quick and effortless, as DialogGPT eliminates the need for training data by intelligently utilizing task names and descriptions for recognition. 

!!! Note "Enhanced Navigation for DialogGPT-based Apps"

    DialogGPT is now the default intent identification mode for AI for Service app creation. The redesigned navigation experience for DialogGPT-based apps enhances discoverability and streamlines the AI Agent creation process for users. The new [Playground](../automation/testing/playground.md) feature provides an integrated side-by-side view of Debug Logs and Talk to Bot for streamlined testing and debugging.
