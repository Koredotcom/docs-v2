5. **Preview the email** to see how it will appear to the recipient.
6. **Include links** to relevant resources (such as the Admin Console or application-specific guides) for easy access.


## Manage Templates

* The system organizes templates by application and shows all applications that you provision to your account.
* The system provides default subject and body text for your convenience, but you can modify them as needed.
* Changes that you make to templates apply to all future invitation emails of that type.
* Admins and Custom Admins can make final adjustments to ensure templates meet organizational standards before the system sends invitations.
* Each application maintains its own separate member invitation template.

The email template includes a link to the Admin Console, ensuring that the invited member can easily access the necessary resources.
