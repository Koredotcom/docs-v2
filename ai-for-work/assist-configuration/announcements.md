# Announcements

The **Announcements** feature in the **Admin Hub** under **Assistant Configurations** allows administrators to create, manage, and publish organizational messages. Announcements appear as banners at the top of the user interface, ensuring important updates are delivered in a clear and timely manner.

## Managing Published Announcements

Make changes to published announcements with clear prompts that help you manage updates effectively. This workflow ensures you always know the status of your edits and can control when changes go live.

* Editing a published announcement triggers a prompt with two options:
    * **Discard changes**
    * **Publish changes**
* This ensures updates are intentional and controlled.

!!! note
    You must publish again to push your changes to users. The system will prompt you to either publish or discard your modifications. This ensures updates are intentional and controlled.
