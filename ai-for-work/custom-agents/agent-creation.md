# Agent Creation

The agent creation feature provides a streamlined interface that enables the creation of new agents. The system adapts its behavior based on workspace access and permissions.

## Create Agent Button

* Users with appropriate permissions see the **Create Agent** button in the Agents and Flows section.
* The system hides the **Create Agent** button from users who lack Personal Workspace access and have no shared workspace access.
* The interface hides filter options (*My Agents* and *Shared Agents*) for users who haven't created any agents.

## Agent Creation Process

Select Agent type:

1. Navigate to the Agent and Flow section and click **Manage**.
