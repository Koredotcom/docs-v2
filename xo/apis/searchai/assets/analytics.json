Disclaimer: PropStream does not offer investing advice or make any profit promises. This article is for educational purposes only. We recommend doing your due diligence and/or consulting financial professionals before investing in real estate in Columbus, Ohio. Columbus, Ohio, was recently named the most popular housing market based on the number of views per listed property adjusted for market size. The city’s listings attracted 2.4 times the number of views on average than homes across the U.S. Furthermore, Columbus had a high share of interest from outside its market: 32.1% of home shoppers came from outside the Midwest. So what’s driving the growing demand for Columbus property, and what makes it an excellent location for real estate professionals? Read on to find out! Property Sales Are On the Rise In October 2024, the Columbus, OH, area had 2,539 home sales, up 7.6% from last year. Meanwhile, 2024 home sales through October reached 24,409, up 3.6% from the same period last year. Some of this sale uptick may be the result of gradually falling mortgage rates. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage went from a recent peak of 7.79% in October 2023 to 6.6% as of 12 December 2024. That’s a 1.19% drop, which can significantly increase a homebuyer’s budget, driving more demand. Home Values Are Growing But Still Well Below National Median Another reason Columbus home sales are up may be the city’s relative affordability. In October 2024, the median home sales price was $315,000. That’s 3.3% more than last year but 26% lower than October’s national median list price ( $424,950 ). Meanwhile, Columbus’s average price per square foot in October 2024 was $201.65, up 4.1% from last year but down 11% from the national median . In other words, Columbus is affordable and growing, making it an attractive market for real estate professionals. Real Estate Inventory Is Ramping Up Columbus area homes for sale reached 4,880 in October, up 27.8% from last year. Similarly, months' supply of inventory (the number of months it would take to sell all listed properties at the current sales rate) hit 2.0, up from 1.6 last year. Part of this inventory jump can be attributed to the “ lock-in effect ” easing. As mortgage rates fall, more homeowners are willing to give up their pandemic-era low rates by listing their homes for sale. Additionally, residential building permits have been on the rise since 2022 , increasing supply as homes are finished. Housing Demand Still Hot That said, Columbus’s housing supply still lags behind demand. That’s why real estate prices are still rising and homes often sell within days of going on the market and above asking price . While days on market have grown from 22 in October 2023 to 28 in October 2024, they’re still well below the national average of 34 . Part of what’s driving demand for Columbus homes is homebuyers looking to move from more expensive markets. For example, among out-of-state shoppers, homebuyers from New York showed the highest interest , followed by Virginia and California. 6 Reasons to Work In Columbus, OH Now that you understand the current Columbus housing market, here’s why you may want to consider working here as a real estate agent or investor: High population growth. In 2023, Columbus had a population of 913,175 , up 0.8% from 2020 and 16.0% from 2010. As the city continues to grow, so will housing demand, pushing up home values and rents. This means higher potential commissions for agents and higher potential returns for investors. Robust job sector. Columbus’s growth is partly due to its strong job market. In October 2024, the city had an unemployment rate of 3.3% , compared to a national rate of 4.1%. Furthermore, Columbus’s gross domestic product (GDP) keeps growing, hitting over $148 billion in 2023. Some of the city’s largest employers include JPMorgan Chase & Co., Nationwide, Amazon, and Honda. Landlord-friendly regulations. Ohio ranks ninth out of all fifty U.S. states for being the most landlord-friendly. This means investors (and agents who serve investors) can expect",

Although rental prices have begun to stabilize, rates will likely keep rising this year thanks to a housing shortage and high mortgage rates. 8. Toledo, OH Toledo may be a great place to invest in real estate if you’re just getting started since the median home price in November 2022 was only $161,000. You may also see some fast-paced appreciation as home sales will likely grow by 4.2% and prices by 6.7% in 2023. This year, Toledo expects exciting new developments , such as building new apartments in the historic area to attract higher-income tenants. The city’s recent $67.5 million renovation project at the Glass City Center should also attract more visitors and boost the local economy. 9. Knoxville, TN Fox News listed Knoxville as one of the top real estate markets as the city’s population experienced its greatest growth since 2007 . This is no surprise, though, considering Knoxville’s housing inventory started to improve last year, and its job market remains strong. The city’s median home price is $331,100 , but rental rates and home prices are both expected to rise this year by around 4%. 10. Huntsville, AL Huntsville also appeared on the list of top markets, and for good reason. With a median home price of $327,500 , Rocket City is one of the most affordable markets that are still well populated right now. Not to mention, jobs and population are both on the rise there.

Several US cities are expected to offer excellent investment opportunities this year due to job growth, increased rental demand, and several other factors. Curious about which areas you should keep an eye on? In this article, we’ll cover 10 of the best cities for investors in 2023 and why these cities made the list. Table of Contents Austin, TX Hartford, CT El Paso, TX Phoenix, AZ Buffalo, NY Tampa, FL Columbia, SC Toledo, OH Knoxville, TN Huntsville, AL 1. Austin, TX Austin’s housing inventory is expected to increase this year, which may help keep home prices and buyer competition relatively low compared to other markets. Even though rental rate growth has recently begun to cool, rent was still up 24.7% in December 2022 compared to late 2019. These factors—along with a healthy job market—make Austin a good city to keep on your radar for investing in 2023. 2. Hartford, CT Hartford, CT, is expected to be one of the top markets for 2023 , with home prices set to grow by 8.5% and sales to increase by 6.5%. The other good news is that rent is on the rise in Hartford, with the average rent reaching $1,472 by the end of 2022. Some local renters may be concerned about affordability, but economists expect Hartford to attract out-of-state buyers and renters who can afford higher housing expenses. 3. El Paso, TX El Paso is the second-best Texas city on our list, as home sales are expected to grow by 8.9% and prices by 5.4%. Rental rates have continued to increase, with apartment rates up 10.6% since last year. Since housing is still relatively affordable in El Paso, local analysts say the city is attracting remote workers from higher-income areas. They also expect the local job market to expand as companies like Amazon and TJ Maxx bring better-paying hourly jobs. 4. Phoenix, AZ Phoenix’s strong economy makes it a top contender for great places to invest in 2023. Arizona as a whole ranked fourth last year for job market growth, and Phoenix specifically saw median earnings rise by 5.7%. The city’s housing market shows positive signs, too. By September 2022, available listings had grown by 257% , giving investors more room to negotiate and find a great deal. 5. Buffalo, NY Buffalo is another one of the more affordable markets, with a median home price of only $240,000 in 2022. As sellers lower their asking prices , sales are expected to rise by 6.3% this year. The city’s job market growth and low unemployment rate also make it an attractive place to invest in 2023. Matthew Roland, assistant dean and clinical assistant professor at the University at Buffalo, says the city’s economy is shifting from manufacturing to education and medical, which means household income may grow. 6. Tampa, FL Tampa home prices have increased by almost 18% compared to the nationwide average of 11%, yet the market still can’t keep up with demand as more people move into the area. Local leaders expect Hillsborough County’s population to grow from 1.5 million to 1.6 million by 2026—a good sign for long-term market growth and home appreciation. With a median home sale price of $364,990 in late 2022, Tampa is one of the more costly places to invest. But its steady population growth and rental demand make it a strong option for real estate investing. 7. Columbia, SC The median single-family home price in Columbia was around $250,000 in December 2022. But prices are expected to keep rising as retirees and remote workers continue moving to the area. Sales are expected to increase by 7.7% in 2023, and home prices to follow suit by 3.6%. Rental demand looks like it will hold strong, too. Although rental prices have begun to stabilize, rates will likely keep rising this year thanks to a housing shortage and high mortgage rates. 8. Toledo, OH Toledo may be a great place to invest in real estate if you’re just getting started since the median home price in November 2022 was only $161,000. You may also see some fast-paced appreciation as home sales will likely grow by 4.",

Tiny Homes Vs. Guest Houses: What’s the Difference? Disclaimer : PropStream doesn’t offer advice on adding ADUs, tiny homes, or guest houses to your property or renting them out. We recommend researching local zoning laws and working with a legal professional before investing in them. With home affordability the worst it’s been since 1984 , alternative housing options like accessory dwelling units (ADUs) and tiny homes are becoming increasingly popular. A recent Freddie Mac consumer survey found that after learning what an ADU is, 32% of respondents who don’t own one expressed interest in having one in the future. Similarly, an IDX1031 survey found that 56% of Americans would consider living in a tiny home, and 86% of those who’ve never owned a home said they’d consider buying one as their first property. As an investor or agent, you can capitalize on these trends. But first, you must understand the differences between ADUs, tiny homes, and guest houses. Though often used interchangeably, they mean different things. Key Takeaways: 🔑 It's crucial for real estate professionals to distinguish between Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs), tiny homes, and guest houses. While often used interchangeably, they serve different purposes and may have different regulations. 🔑 Before considering the addition of ADUs, tiny homes, or guest houses, it's essential to understand the regulatory landscape. Local zoning laws and permitting processes play a crucial role in determining the feasibility of these housing options. 🔑 Evaluating the cost and potential return on investment (ROI) is a critical factor in deciding whether to invest in ADUs, tiny homes, or guest houses. 🔑 The demand for ADUs, tiny homes, and guest houses is on the rise, fueled by factors such as a housing shortage, multi-generational living trends, and increased remote work. What Is an ADU? An accessory dwelling unit (ADU) is a secondary housing unit that shares a lot with another primary property. It’s a fixed structure with its own entrance, bathroom, and kitchen—everything a resident needs to live independently from the main home. There are three main ADU types: attached, detached, and internal. Attached An attached ADU (AADU) is structurally connected to the main home. For example, it may be an apartment built onto the back or side of the house. Detached A detached ADU (DADU) is a separate structure from the main home, such as a backyard cottage or a detached garage. Internal An internal ADU (IADU) is an ADU that exists entirely within the primary structure. A section of the interior space is converted into its own living space with a separate entrance. ADUs can serve as long- or short-term rentals, guest housing, home offices, housing for elderly parents or adult children, and more. They’re the most versatile alternative housing structure. What Is a Tiny Home? A tiny home is a residence that is significantly smaller than a traditional house—usually 100 to 400 square feet. Unlike ADUs, tiny homes don’t have to share a lot with another property and are generally portable, i.e., they lack a foundation and have wheels. Though they can be used similarly to ADUs (depending on the state), tiny homes are best suited for housing one or two residents due to their small size. What Is a Guest House? A guest house is a small dwelling on a single-family property meant for short-term visitors. Unlike ADUs and tiny homes, guest houses can’t provide permanent housing. They’re just a private space for family and friends to spend the night comfortably. Most guest houses have a bedroom with a half or three-quarters bathroom and no kitchen, relying on the primary home for cooking and other amenities. How are ADUs, Tiny Homes, and Guest Houses Regulated? Now that you know the main differences between ADUs, tiny homes, and guest houses, let’s review how they are regulated. ADU Regulations ADU regulations vary by state and city. In California, for example, they’ve been legal since 1982. However, at the time, many local governments implemented barriers to building them. Since then, the state has passed laws preventing cities from hindering ADU construction, leading to a 1,421% increase in California ADU permits from 2016 to 2021. Other states don’t allow AD",

Disclaimer : PropStream does not offer financial advice. We recommend consulting a financial professional and performing thorough research before making an investment decision based on current or future mortgage interest rates. Since March 2022, the Federal Reserve has raised its Federal Funds Rate—which serves as a benchmark for all other interest rates—11 times to a 22-year high . Average mortgage rates have followed suit, topping 8% for the first time since 2000. However, buyer activity has started to slow, with home sales hitting a 13-year low in September. As a real estate pro, it’s important to understand how mortgage interest rates affect the housing market so you can make more informed business decisions. Key Takeaways: 🔑 Fluctuations in mortgage interest rates significantly impact home affordability for buyers. A seemingly modest increase in interest rates can substantially raise monthly payments, potentially affecting buyers' ability to qualify for loans. 🔑 Mortgage rates influence buyer behavior, with rising rates often leading to a decline in buyer demand. Homeownership becomes more expensive, discouraging potential buyers. 🔑 Understanding the factors influencing mortgage rates, primarily the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, is crucial for anticipating market trends. The Impact of Mortgage Rates on Home Affordability Considering that 80% of homebuyers (and 97% of first-time homebuyers ) finance their home purchase, changes in mortgage interest rates can have a dramatic impact on home affordability. Consider the following: A $500,000 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at a 3% interest rate would have a monthly mortgage payment of $2,108. The same mortgage at a 7% interest rate would have a monthly payment of $3,327. That’s an extra $1,219 monthly and $438,840 over the 30-year loan term—nearly the original loan amount. Keep in mind that most traditional lenders want homebuyers to pay no more than a third of their gross income on housing. So, a homebuyer earning $100,000 per year could theoretically get approved for the $500,000 mortgage at 3% (assuming they meet the other creditworthiness requirements). However, the buyer would unlikely qualify for the same mortgage at 7%. This is a problem today, as the average US salary is around $60,575 , and the average cost of a home today is over $400,000. How Mortgage Rates Change Buyer Behavior Since mortgage rates impact home affordability, they, in turn, impact buyer activity. Buyer Demand When mortgage rates rise, and home ownership becomes more expensive, buyer demand tends to decline. When mortgage rates fall and homeownership becomes more affordable, buyer demand tends to pick up. This explains why mortgage applications are declining: Higher mortgage rates discourage homebuying. According to the Mortgage Banker Association, mortgage application activity recently fell to its lowest since 1995 . Similarly, existing home sales fell to a 13-year low of 3.96 million in September . Even though 7-8% mortgage rates are relatively normal compared to historical averages , many homebuyers have become accustomed to the low 3-4% rates of the past 15 years . Plus, the average cost for a home in the United States is about 642% higher than when interest rates were at their height in 1981, at 16.35% ($64,600 in 1981 compared to $479,500 in 2022). Although the interest rates were nearly double in 1981, the increase in median home prices compared to the rise in salary for the average American household ( $22,390 in 1981 vs. $74,580 in 2022 ; app. A 233% increase) has made the 7-8% interest rate have a more significant impact on home affordability in the modern day. Refinancing Activity Mortgage rates also affect refinancing activity. Refinancing replaces an existing loan with a new one, usually under better terms. For example, a homeowner may want to refinance their outstanding mortgage debt if interest rates fall. Why? Because doing so could lower their monthly payment and the loan’s final cost. Additionally, a cash-out refinance could let them withdraw equity from the property to put toward home renovations or other financial needs. When mortgage rates fall, demand for refinancing tends to rise. When mortgage rates rise, demand for refinancing tends to decrease. Currently, the mortgage refinancing industry is relatively inactive. In Q1 2023, refinancing originations amounted to $47 billion, down over 90% from Q1 2021 . The reason is simple: Fewer homeowners",

Real estate investing is becoming an increasingly appealing career option for people who want to be their own boss, have endless earning potential, and build generational wealth. That being said, high housing costs can be a barrier for many aspiring investors. But what if it didn’t have to? Whether you’re interested in wholesaling, flipping, or buying and holding real estate, there are plenty of funding options to help you secure an investment property. Since so many options are available, it can be daunting to start learning what funding sources are available to you depending on your credit, borrowing history, or income. This is why we broke down what loans are available for the different types of real estate investors and the qualifications for each. Keep reading to learn more. Table of Contents Loan Types for Wholesalers Transactional Loan Loan Types for Flippers Fix and Flip Loan Renovation or Personal Loan Loan Types for Buy and Hold Investors Conventional Loan FHA Loan VA Loan Blanket Mortgage Portfolio HELOC or Home Equity Loan Seller Carryback Subject To Disclaimer: This article is intended for information purposes. Before applying for a loan or financial assistance, please get advice from a financial professional to determine if a financing option is right for your situation and determine your tax and legal responsibilities. Loan Types for Wholesalers In most wholesale transactions, the wholesaler will assign the contract rather than sell the property themselves. In this type of transaction, the wholesaler (in most cases) never technically owns the property. Because this is the easiest and least complex option for a wholesaler, assigning contracts is the ideal method of closing a wholesale deal. However, in some contracts, the seller does not permit the wholesaler to sell the contract. Instead, the wholesaler must purchase the property for a very short period (typically 1-3 days) before selling it to the buyer they’ve found. In this situation, a wholesaler will need a transactional loan. Transactional Loan A transactional loan is a short-term loan that allows wholesalers to close a deal without tying up their own assets in the transaction. With a transactional loan, the wholesaler will use it to purchase a property before turning around and selling it to their buyer. Transactional funding for wholesalers is beneficial because it typically doesn’t require a certain percentage down, a credit check, or proof of employment. As long as the deal is strong, a transactional lender will likely provide wholesalers with the short-term funds they need to close their next deal. Loan Types for Flippers For flippers, securing a funding source that will cover both the property purchase and renovations is important. Many beginners don’t have enough cash for a down payment and to pay for labor, materials, etc. There are a few different types of loans flippers can lean on, depending on their circumstances: Fix and Flip Loan A fix and flip loan is a form of short-term financing that enables flippers to finance both the property they want to flip and the necessary renovations. Also known as a “rehab loan,” a fix and flip loan is a subset of a category of loans known as “bridge loans.” While fix and flip loans have higher interest rates, investors can typically pay them off once they’ve sold their flip. Additionally, these loans often have more flexible terms than conventional loans, and the flipper may be able to access the funds sooner. To receive the necessary funds for your flip, your lender will typically use the ARV (after repair value) of a potential flip to determine how much they can lend. This ensures they aren’t losing money on the deal. Pro tip: When financing a fix and flip property, you may find it helpful to follow the 70% rule. The 70% rule means you shouldn’t pay more than 70% of the ARV after subtracting the renovation costs to profit from the flip. Example (feel free to plug your own numbers into this table to calculate): Renovation or Personal Loan Some fix and flip investors like to perform “live-in flipping.” With live-in flipping, an investor will make the house they’re flipping their primary residence, often selling for a higher profit after about two years. Once they sell the live-in flip, they will repeat the process. Eventually, this method may help investors save the funds they need to begin purchasing separate properties to flip, eliminating the need to move every couple of",

We recommend consulting with legal and/or financial professionals and doing your due diligence before investing in any properties. Many real estate investors start locally, but what if your market is too competitive, with high property values or strict regulations? Investing beyond your backyard—long-distance real estate investing—can be a smarter, more strategic move. Dive in to discover why and explore eight tips to succeed with this approach! Why Invest in Real Estate Long Distance? Investing in real estate long-distance can widen your investment prospects. For example, you may find markets with higher potential returns, better cash flow, or more landlord-friendly laws . Furthermore, long-distance real estate investing can help you diversify geographically. Instead of owning property in only one market, you can own property in multiple, minimizing your exposure to a downturn in any one. That said, long-distance real estate investing has its challenges. It may be harder to learn the market, find reliable contractors, and communicate across time zones. To mitigate these and other potential risks, follow these tips: 1. Research the Market Thoroughly Before you settle on a market to invest in, carefully study it. Learn its unique dynamics and trends so you can recognize a good deal when you see one. Here are some factors to consider: Property values Average rent Average vacancy rates Population growth Local employers Unemployment rates School ratings Crime rates Transportation options Overall, look for a market with a growing population, thriving economy, strong rental demand, low operating costs, and reasonable property prices. Of course, no market is perfect, but you might be surprised at the opportunities outside your local market. 2. Build a Reliable Local Team Once you’ve chosen a market, it’s time to build your team. This is extremely important when investing long-distance because you’re not there to manage properties in person. Your real estate team can include local agents, contractors, lawyers, lenders, insurance providers, property managers , and other investors. Each should serve a purpose—whether that’s managing your properties, executing renovations, facilitating transactions, or educating you on the market’s nuances and local regulations. Above all, your team members should be trustworthy. Ask your existing network for referrals, check online reviews, and look out for candidates with a strong reputation. 3. Leverage Technology Another must for managing properties from afar is technology. These days, there are many software options for streamlining everyday landlord tasks, such as rent collection, tenant screening, maintenance requests, and recordkeeping. There’s even virtual tour technology that lets you inspect and show properties remotely. Consider investing in some of these tools to automate repetitive tasks and free up time to find and analyze more real estate deals. 4. Communicate Regularly Clear and frequent communication is always important when managing real estate, especially when you’re far away from your tenants and team. Fortunately, there’s never been a better time to communicate long distance. With video calls, texts, and other digital channels, you can keep an open line of communication with tenants or outsource it to a property manager who can give you regular updates. Set a regular communication schedule with them so everyone stays on the same page. 5. Visit the Property Periodically Just because you’re an absentee landlord doesn’t mean you can’t visit your properties. Sometimes, visiting your investments to see them in person is worthwhile as it can provide a better sense of their value, condition, and needed maintenance. Of course, your property manager can handle this for you, too, but checking in helps keep them accountable. Plus, it can improve your relationships with tenants. Consider scheduling an annual visit to each of your properties to check in. 6. Establish Clear Processes and Protocols Without clear processes for managing properties remotely, your business may struggle. Set up systems for marketing rental units, screening tenants, collecting rent, responding to maintenance requests and emergencies, and more. Efficient standard operating procedures (SOPs) that comply with local regulations can help minimize errors and prevent important tasks from falling through the cracks. 7. Monitor Financial Performance Keep a close eye on your investments’ financial metrics. That way, if they no longer serve your goals or fail to perform, you can explore exit strategies. One easy way to track your rental income, property expenses, and ROI is to invest in accounting software. It can automatically calculate your returns and provide a dashboard to check investment performances",

                        "chunkText": " It’s no different from what a company like GEICO, for example, does with its ads all the time. They don't expect you to buy insurance after each commercial—whether it's a radio ad, a television ad, or a crossover ad with another company. Also, be sure to use a CRM to make notes as you reach out and follow up with people. Q: What mistakes do you often see real estate agents make when they’re reaching out to cold leads? They give up way too quickly. It can take up to six to 12 months before cold outreach begins to produce the fruit you want. It takes time to build an agent brand—maybe 17 to 25 touches. Each touch is a layer that gets you closer to your goal. I also see agents not doing enough calls to produce momentum. Not calling enough is like not pedaling a bicycle. If the bike's wheels aren’t turning fast enough, it will just fall down. You've got to keep the momentum up. Next, some agents don’t properly listen for cues. Here’s an example: somebody who is going to sell their house is not going to say, “Oh, we're thinking of selling. Come on over.” They’re going to say, “How is the market?” and ask similar questions. You have to listen for those cues and follow up on that interest. Q: What communication tips do you have for agents seeking to get clients through cold outreach? When first reaching out to a lead, I make it a point to speak a bit quickly and not start out asking, “How are you?” That will just result in a fast “Not interested.” Instead, I say, “ The purpose of my call is …” Short and to the point has always worked best for me with cold calling. Secondly—and this connects with my prior answer—I see some agents relying too much on scripts. Instead of reading straight from a script, they should say, “Hey, tell me about you,” and get them to talk a little bit or find a connection. I always try to be real and connect wherever there is an opening. For example, I was interacting with a lead whose last name was Cairo, and I said, “Funny, I’m in Chicago. Any relation to the Cairo Animal Hospital?” And he says, “No, but I lived in Chicago.” That allowed us to start talking, and then he said, “I don’t usually take calls from guys like you.” Later on, he called me back, and that wouldn’t have happened without finding that camaraderie quickly and listening to his cues. Q: What’s your final piece of advice for agents who want to start cold calling? Don’t give up! Remember, it takes six to 12 months to really see a difference. Also, make sure you always keep your appointments with leads, and don’t break them. Let PropStream Set You Up for Cold-Calling Success! Cold-calling can be an excellent way to reach out to prospects if you stay consistent, personable, and follow up with various other methods.

                        "chunkText": ", and guest houses, let’s review how they are regulated. ADU Regulations ADU regulations vary by state and city. In California, for example, they’ve been legal since 1982. However, at the time, many local governments implemented barriers to building them. Since then, the state has passed laws preventing cities from hindering ADU construction, leading to a 1,421% increase in California ADU permits from 2016 to 2021. Other states don’t allow ADUs at all or have strict requirements regarding their size, occupancy limits, required parking space, and ability to be rented out. Keep in mind that once built, an ADU cannot be sold separately from the main property since it sits on the same lot. They must be sold together. Tiny Home Regulations Because tiny homes lack a foundation, they are usually not considered real estate but recreational vehicles (RVs). As such, they must be registered with the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and are subject to vehicle taxes instead of property taxes. Tiny homes also don’t meet most building codes and typically can’t be connected to the city grid except in designated areas such as mobile home parks. Some cities are more accepting of tiny homes than others. For example, Los Angeles has allowed them in backyards since 2019 . Other cities don’t, or if they do, require them to be accessible via driveway. Sometimes, you can rent out a tiny home if you own the land it sits on and it has all the necessary living amenities. Unlike ADUs, however, tiny homes can and must be sold separately from the main property since they are not physically attached. Guest House Regulations Guest houses are the most limited in their legal use. Unlike ADUs and tiny homes, they aren’t equipped with kitchens and consequently aren’t permitted for permanent residency or rental housing. Again, zoning restrictions vary by city. However, you may find them more lenient than those for ADUs and tiny homes since guest houses are for private use only. ❗Before constructing any of these alternative housing structures, consult a local attorney who specializes in the one you’re interested in and knows the relevant regulations. Also, investigate the permits needed within the county. Cost and Potential ROI of ADUs, Tiny Homes, and Guest Houses The cost and potential return on investment (ROI) of ADUs, tiny homes, and guest houses is another major factor to consider before investing in one. The average ADU costs between $150,000 and $400,000, depending on location, size, quality, and other factors. It’s generally the most expensive of the three housing types, but it also has the highest potential ROI. According to a Porch study , ADUs in big cities can increase your property’s value by up to 35%! In contrast, tiny homes typically only cost $30,000 to $60,000 because they are smaller and don’t require a foundation. Keep in mind, however, that since they are not attached to land (which tends to appreciate in value over time), tiny homes tend to depreciate the way vehicles do. Guest houses cost an average of $55,000 . Because they are fixed to the primary property, they tend to appreciate over time, potentially providing a positive ROI. However, you won’t benefit from steady rental income since guest houses can’t be rented out. The Growing Demand for ADUs, Tiny Homes, and Guest Houses Demand for ADUs, tiny homes, and guest houses is rising, not least because the U.S. is experiencing a record housing shortage. These smaller residential units can help fill the gap of 6.5 million missing homes . Additionally, multi-generational living is becoming more common. According to the Pew Research Center , the number of U.S. young adults who live with their parents is at an all-time high for the first time since the Great Depression. Similarly, many Americans without retirement savings choose to move in with their adult children . Furthermore, increased remote work has boosted demand for office ADUs. According to the U.S. Census Bureau , the number of people primarily working from home tripled between 2019 and 2021. Loosening regulations are also contributing to a growing demand for smaller residential units. In October, the U.S. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced new policies that let lenders count ADU rental income when underwriting mortgages. Similarly, California has set aside a budget of $50 million to pay some homeowners to build ADUs. Now may be as good a time as any to invest in an ADU, tiny home, or guest house. Just be sure to check local regulations, get the proper permits, and work with a professional. Share Published by PropStream November 27, 2023 ",

                        "chunkText": " profit. Blanket Mortgage A blanket mortgage is one mortgage that covers two or more separate pieces of real estate. This type of mortgage loan is ideal for developers or real estate investors who plan on investing in several properties at once, as it allows them to finance multiple properties under one loan. Many borrowers use blanket mortgages to purchase several properties before building on them or flipping the structures that already exist on them. They’ll then sell each piece of property for a profit. If you already own several properties with different loans, you may even be able to consolidate those loans into own blanket mortgage. This can help you lower your interest rate and increase your capitalization rate . Another benefit of using a blanket mortgage is the ability to cut down on upfront fees you have to pay to take out separate loans. If you take out several mortgage loans, each will come with its own application fees and closing costs, whereas a blanket mortgage only requires one. Additionally, many blanket mortgages have what’s known as a “release clause.” The release clause allows you to sell individual properties at separate times before putting the profits from the sale toward a new investment property. With blanket mortgages, you may have to pay a larger down payment to secure your bundle of properties, or you may need to pay off the entire loan within a designated period. Also, if you fail to make the mortgage payment, the lender may be able to take control of all of the properties under that one loan. Portfolio Loan Many mortgage loans are originated by a lender before being offloaded and sold to the secondary mortgage market . What is the secondary mortgage market? The secondary mortgage market connects lenders, investors, and homebuyers nationwide in one efficient system to help millions of families and renters find their homes. Portfolio loans are the exception to this typical structure. Instead, portfolio loans are originated and retained by the original lender. Why is this important? Well, when a lender doesn’t send a loan into the secondary mortgage market, they can set their own requirements for the loan (credit score required, the amount borrowed, income history, etc.). When a lender can set their own loan terms, they don’t have to follow the standards required by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. For borrowers with lower credit scores who need to borrow larger sums of money, a portfolio loan may be the best option. Also, portfolio loans can be ideal for self-employed borrowers, as many lenders require an employment history if they’re lending on your deal. If your credit score is on the lower end, you may find portfolio loans are a viable option for refinancing existing mortgage loans as well. You may pay a higher interest rate with portfolio loans since the loan terms are often less flexible. The riskier a deal is for a lender, the higher return they’ll typically expect from it. Also, a lender may charge higher fees to take out a portfolio loan if they know a borrower is unlikely to secure a loan elsewhere. HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit) or Home Equity Loan If you own your primary residence and you’ve built up a decent amount of equity in it, you may be able to tap into this equity to purchase an investment property using a home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC). A HELOC is a line of credit from which a homeowner can withdraw to perform renovations, fund a personal expense, or even invest in a property. The amount of equity you have in your property will determine your credit limit. A home equity loan is similar to a HELOC because it allows you to use home equity to borrow money. However, where the HELOC allows you to put expenses as they come up on credit, a home equity loan is provided to you in a lump sum that you can use as you see fit. While a home equity loan and a HELOC have several similarities, they differ regarding interest rate percentage and payment plan options. For example, a HELOC may require a variable rate, and the monthly payment will depend on what you’ve borrowed, while a home equity loan may have a set monthly amount with a fixed interest rate. It’s important to note that just because you have a certain amount of equity built up in a property, that doesn’t mean a lender will offer you the funds to invest in a rental property. Willingness to lend using home equity on an investment property will vary from lender to lender as they may consider it a riskier investment. Also, they may have stricter requirements when it comes to credit, debt-to-income ratio, number of open accounts, and more to qualify. Important: With the HELOC and the home equity loan, you’ll likely need to use your home as collateral if you can’t make your payments on what you’re borrowing. We recommend extensive research and consulting with a financial advisor before committing to anything. Seller Carry",

                        "chunkText": " to calculate): Renovation or Personal Loan Some fix and flip investors like to perform “live-in flipping.” With live-in flipping, an investor will make the house they’re flipping their primary residence, often selling for a higher profit after about two years. Once they sell the live-in flip, they will repeat the process. Eventually, this method may help investors save the funds they need to begin purchasing separate properties to flip, eliminating the need to move every couple of years. This flipping method works well for investors who are just starting and only need to use flipping as a side hustle. Full-time flippers will need to perform more flips to make a livable income. With a live-in flip, you may be able to lean on a renovation or personal loan to afford your renovations. Since you don’t need to account for the purchase price if you already own the home with a conventional loan, you can take out a smaller loan to fund renovations separate from your mortgage. If you’re looking at buying a property to live in for a couple of years to flip, you may be able to have a renovation loan added to your mortgage so you can get the funds to renovate right when you purchase the property. Loan Types for Buy and Hold Investors While wholesalers and flippers are limited to a few loan types, buy and hold investors have quite a few more options. Here are some financing options to help you secure a rental property: Conventional Loan Conventional loans are long-term loans with lower interest rates than private or hard-money loans, often provided by a bank, credit union, or other financial institution. Because these loans enable you to pay off the mortgage over a longer timeframe and the interest rates are lower, it is an ideal loan for rental owners if they fit the stricter criteria to qualify for a conventional loan Requirements include Clean borrowing history: No liens, foreclosures, short sales, etc. Promising financial history: Conventional loans require higher credit scores (typically at least 620) and your history should be clear of financial red flags like bankruptcies. Employment history: Many conventional lenders require proof of 1 year or more of employment to qualify for a conventional loan. Down payment: For a conventional loan, you’ll typically need a down payment of 10% or more. Low debt-to-income ratio: Your debt-to-income ratio should be less than 50%. FHA (Federal Housing Administration) Loan An FHA loan is a type of home mortgage backed by the Federal Housing Administration. It’s meant to help buyers with low-moderate income levels afford homeownership with fewer up-front costs. It is considered a non-conforming loan . While FHA loans aren’t technically supposed to be used for investment properties, there are ways you can get around this technicality. For example, you can’t use an FHA loan to purchase a new property solely for investment purposes, but you may be able to rent out parts of a property you buy to live on. Many investors purchase multi-family properties with up to four units and live in one of the units. This is also known as “house hacking.” If you can have your mortgage paid off by your tenants, an FHA loan doesn’t enforce pre-payment penalties, so you may be able to sell your home for a significant profit if it appreciates in value. If you can profit from these tenants in addition to having your mortgage paid each month, in time, you could use these extra funds for a down payment on a separate rental property. Important note: Your ability to have multiple families on your property will depend on local regulations. We recommend researching and understanding the legality of house hacking for your property before taking on tenants. VA Loan A VA loan is a type of mortgage loan available to eligible military borrowers. The VA loan is available through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs . This loan is meant to help service members, veterans, or their surviving spouses purchase a property without a high down payment or interest rate. Like the FHA loan, you can’t use a VA loan to purchase a separate investment property. Instead, you can use it to purchase a multi-family property in which you live in one of the units and rent the others out to tenants, either breaking even and having your mortgage paid for or earning a profit. Blanket Mortgage A blanket mortgage is one mortgage that covers two or more separate pieces of real estate. This type of mortgage loan is ideal for developers or real estate investors who plan on investing in several properties at once, as it allows them to finance multiple properties under one loan. Many borrowers use blanket mortgages to purchase several properties before building on them or flipping the structures that already exist on them. They’ll then sell each piece of property for a profit. If you already own several properties",

That said, many agents find cold outreach in any form intimidating—not to mention exhausting, as it typically takes numerous follow-ups to make a sale. So, how can agents improve their communication and make their cold outreach more effective? To answer this question, PropStream spoke with Jeff Lichtenstein, a broker in Boca Raton and CEO of Echo Fine Properties , which employs over 100 agents. Read our exclusive Q&A with him below to get tips on how to expand your business with strategic outreach. Q: Can you tell me about a time when you won over a great client through cold outreach? I called a gentleman to invite him to an open house. He told me he was dying of terminal brain cancer and that his estate was taken care of. Click . That one affected me. I sent a plant and told him I was thinking of him. Four months later, his son called. His dad had passed away. But before he died, he told his son that he wanted me to have the listing. Try PropStream for 7 Days Free! Q: In your personal experience, what methods work best when it comes to cold outreach, and why? For me, the phone has always gotten me the most engagement. Calls get you the quickest growth because you are reaching the most people the fastest. I would place 40 to 50 calls per day, followed by 40 to 50 notecards. The note cards are key as they reinforce the call and are another touch. Door knocking has also worked well for some of our agents. (Tip: Don’t drink water right before you go because you’ll be tempted to give up if you have to go to the bathroom.) Email, text marketing, and postcards are great, but they should be treated as supplemental. Keep in mind that cold outreach methods work with each other. Calling by itself won’t help much unless you do all the other types of outreach, too. It’s the culmination that breaks it open. Q: What is your process for cold outreach for each of the methods you use? First, I recommend picking an area that you're going to do business in and become an expert in that area. Learn that area really well. Then you need a lot of touches or interactions. My goal is generally to have 17 to 24 touches within a certain period of time. It may start out with a cold call, during which I may talk to them or simply leave a short message if they don’t answer. It’s okay if you have to leave a message—a voicemail is an advertisement. In my voicemail, I might say, “We're having an open house this Sunday from 12 to 3,” or “We just put a certain house on the market that's down the street from you.” Just remember to include a call-to-action. After that, on the same day, I send a note card out. The note card may say, “Hey, [Name], just a quick note to say I'm sorry that I missed you. The purpose of my call was …” Or I might say, “It was a pleasure talking with you earlier.” This is where you can show off your follow-up skills. After the postcard, they might see me in person next. Maybe I’m driving the car in their neighborhood, or they meet me at an open house. If I’m knocking on doors, I make sure to have materials to drop off if they don’t answer. I also might follow up with email marketing and texting, but that only works well in areas where I’ve first done some cold calling. I touch base with a person multiple times, and those touches build on one another. It’s no different from what a company like GEICO, for example, does with its ads all the time. They don't expect you to buy insurance after each commercial—whether it's a radio ad, a television ad, or a crossover ad with another company. Also, be sure to use a CRM to make notes as you reach out and follow up with people. Q: What mistakes do you often see real estate agents make when they’re reaching out to cold leads",

When mortgage rates fall, demand for refinancing tends to rise. When mortgage rates rise, demand for refinancing tends to decrease. Currently, the mortgage refinancing industry is relatively inactive. In Q1 2023, refinancing originations amounted to $47 billion, down over 90% from Q1 2021 . The reason is simple: Fewer homeowners want to refinance when doing so typically means settling for a higher interest rate. Meanwhile, some buyers take out new mortgages despite higher interest rates, expecting to refinance to a lower rate if and when interest rates decline. The Effect of Federal Monetary Policy on Mortgage Rates Now that you know how mortgage rates impact buyer activity, consider what causes mortgage rates to fluctuate in the first place. The primary factor at play is federal monetary policy. The Fed deliberately manipulates interest rates to fulfill its dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and stable prices. Inflation If inflation (as measured by the consumer price index) runs higher than the Fed’s target rate of 2% ( as it recently has ), the Fed might increase its key interest rate to raise the cost of borrowing money, thereby cooling the economy. Likewise, if the inflation rate runs at or below 2%, the Fed might lower interest rates to encourage investment and economic growth. Note : Changes in federal interest rates immediately impact 10-year treasury bond yields , to which many mortgage lenders peg their interest rates . Additionally, mortgage lenders are sensitive to inflation itself. The faster the inflation rate, the lower the long-term value of money. To compensate for this decreased value, lenders often raise their interest rates. In October, the annual U.S. inflation rate was 3.2% , well below its 9.1% peak in June 2022. If inflation continues falling, the Fed may be done hiking interest rates, which it hasn’t raised since July. Employment and Consumer Spending If unemployment is high, the Fed might lower interest rates to encourage businesses to expand by hiring more employees. Lower rates also encourage more consumer spending, further supporting businesses' hiring ability. Conversely, when unemployment is low, the Fed might increase interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating. Additionally, lenders may feel more confident about borrowers’ ability to repay loans and raise their interest rates to capitalize on favorable economic conditions. As of October 2023, the U.S. unemployment rate was 3.9% , indicating a resilient job market despite higher interest rates (a healthy unemployment rate is 3-5% ). Additionally, consumer spending was up 0.4% from August to September . How to Anticipate Future Mortgage Rates Nobody knows where mortgage rates will be in the future, but it’s helpful to estimate the direction they will go to make investment decisions accordingly. The Fed’s Economic Outlook At its most recent FOMC meeting, the Fed didn’t rule out another rate hike to combat inflation pressures. At the same time, the central bank has made significant progress in bringing down inflation. Encouragingly, core inflation for the five months ending in October was at a 2.8% annual rate . Consequently, some investors believe the Fed may be done hiking interest rates and may even cut them by May next year. Historically, interest rates follow economic cycles. This means that over time, they go up and down, though predicting their peaks and troughs is nearly impossible. The Bond Yield Curve A common way to gauge future interest rates is to look at the U.S. bond yield curve, which shows the yields of different treasury bonds at various maturity dates (1 month to 30 years). If the graph shows yields are lower for short-term bonds (a standard yield curve), investors expect interest rates to rise. Conversely, if the graph shows yields are higher for short-term bonds (an inverted yield curve), investors expect interest rates to fall. As it stands now, the bond yield curve indicates interest rates are set to fall. Of course, it’s impossible to predict whether interest rates will rise or fall, as other indicators show a resilient economy that could keep interest rates high. Ultimately, some experts expect interest rates to fall in 2024 or 2025 , while others expect them to stay high indefinitely . Business Strategies for Adapting to Current Mortgage Rates As a real estate professional, you must adapt your strategy to work with current mortgage rates and the resulting buyer behavior patterns if you want to continue growing your business. In a high mortgage rate environment, real estate pros must get creative with where they find new leads, as high mortgage rates slow buyer activity. Pursuing motivated sellers in off-market properties can be the golden ticket. Life doesn’t stop just because the real estate market has changed, which means homeowners will always experience situations where they still need to sell and/or buy. PropStream",

You can find these `chunk_id(s)` always **at the end of each content block**.\n    - **Do not include** any chunk_id(s) if the question cannot be answered as the required information is not present.\n    - **Do not hallucinate or guess** chunk_ids.  \n3. Maintain **strict line breaks** to preserve structure, and if the answer includes a process or multiple steps, format it in a **step-by-step** manner for better clarity. \n4. **Bias, Hallucination, and Profanity Handling:**\n    - If the query contains bias, hallucinations, or profanity and is **completely irrelevant**, respond strictly only with:  \n      **The question <insert given irrelevant query> cannot be answered as the required information is not present.**  \n      *(Respond in the same language as the query. For example, in German: Die Frage kann nicht beantwortet werden, da die erforderlichen Informationen nicht vorhanden sind.)*  \n    - If the query includes bias, hallucinations, profanity, or any incorrect assumptions **but relevant information is available**, correct the query carefully and provide only the accurate answer with accurate chunk_id(s) of the selected content at the beginning of the answer.   \n      Example:\n      **Q:** Why the hell does your shitty bank block FCNR accounts for Indians? That’s some foreigner-only crap!  \n      **A:** [chk-<id>]\n      FCNR (B) deposits are available for Non-Resident Indians (NRIs), not for residents.

Unnecessary phrases\n      2. Special characters\n      3. Tokens like context, chunks, content that reveal source information.\n    - If the User Query **explicitly mentions a preferred format (e.g., bullet points, step-wise explanation, or custom examples)**, then **try to follow that format**.\n    - Follow these exact formats for answers:  \n      - 1. **Single Chunk Answer**: `[chk-<id>]\n      Answer text.`  \n      - 2. **Multiple Chunk Answer**: `[chk-<id>][chk-<id>]\n      Answer text.`  \n      - 3. **Unanswerable/Irrelevant Query**: `The question <insert given irrelevant query> cannot be answered as the required information is not present.` *(Strictly do not include any chunk_id(s) in this answer format.)*\n      *(If the query is in another language, provide the irrelevant response STRICTLY in the same language accordingly. Example in German: Die Frage kann nicht beantwortet werden, da die erforderlichen Informationen nicht vorhanden sind.)*  \n7. **Language Handling:**\n      - Always respond in the **same language as the user query** — whether English, German, French, Spanish, Japanese, Polish, or any other.  \n      - The response must **match the user language fluently and naturally**, maintaining clarity and correctness.\n8. If the exact intent, term, concept, or policy asked in the user query is not explicitly mentioned in any chunk, then the answer **must not be** derived from similar or related content. **Do not hallucinate** or assume information or make assumptions based on partially matching concepts. Instead, STRICTLY respond only with:\n      **The question <insert given irrelevant query> cannot be answered as the required information is not present.**\n\n**Refer to the provided examples carefully** and answer the user query below based **only on the content of the chunks**.

Disclaimer: PropStream does not offer investing advice or make any profit promises. This article is for educational purposes only. We recommend doing your due diligence and/or consulting financial professionals before investing in real estate in Columbus, Ohio. Columbus, Ohio, was recently named the most popular housing market based on the number of views per listed property adjusted for market size. The city’s listings attracted 2.4 times the number of views on average than homes across the U.S. Furthermore, Columbus had a high share of interest from outside its market: 32.1% of home shoppers came from outside the Midwest. So what’s driving the growing demand for Columbus property, and what makes it an excellent location for real estate professionals? Read on to find out! Property Sales Are On the Rise In October 2024, the Columbus, OH, area had 2,539 home sales, up 7.6% from last year. Meanwhile, 2024 home sales through October reached 24,409, up 3.6% from the same period last year. Some of this sale uptick may be the result of gradually falling mortgage rates. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage went from a recent peak of 7.79% in October 2023 to 6.6% as of 12 December 2024. That’s a 1.19% drop, which can significantly increase a homebuyer’s budget, driving more demand. Home Values Are Growing But Still Well Below National Median Another reason Columbus home sales are up may be the city’s relative affordability. In October 2024, the median home sales price was $315,000. That’s 3.3% more than last year but 26% lower than October’s national median list price ( $424,950 ). Meanwhile, Columbus’s average price per square foot in October 2024 was $201.65, up 4.1% from last year but down 11% from the national median . In other words, Columbus is affordable and growing, making it an attractive market for real estate professionals. Real Estate Inventory Is Ramping Up Columbus area homes for sale reached 4,880 in October, up 27.8% from last year. Similarly, months' supply of inventory (the number of months it would take to sell all listed properties at the current sales rate) hit 2.0, up from 1.6 last year. Part of this inventory jump can be attributed to the “ lock-in effect ” easing. As mortgage rates fall, more homeowners are willing to give up their pandemic-era low rates by listing their homes for sale. Additionally, residential building permits have been on the rise since 2022 , increasing supply as homes are finished. Housing Demand Still Hot That said, Columbus’s housing supply still lags behind demand. That’s why real estate prices are still rising and homes often sell within days of going on the market and above asking price . While days on market have grown from 22 in October 2023 to 28 in October 2024, they’re still well below the national average of 34 . Part of what’s driving demand for Columbus homes is homebuyers looking to move from more expensive markets. For example, among out-of-state shoppers, homebuyers from New York showed the highest interest , followed by Virginia and California. 6 Reasons to Work In Columbus, OH Now that you understand the current Columbus housing market, here’s why you may want to consider working here as a real estate agent or investor: High population growth. In 2023, Columbus had a population of 913,175 , up 0.8% from 2020 and 16.0% from 2010. As the city continues to grow, so will housing demand, pushing up home values and rents. This means higher potential commissions for agents and higher potential returns for investors. Robust job sector. Columbus’s growth is partly due to its strong job market. In October 2024, the city had an unemployment rate of 3.3% , compared to a national rate of 4.1%. Furthermore, Columbus’s gross domestic product (GDP) keeps growing, hitting over $148 billion in 2023. Some of the city’s largest employers include JPMorgan Chase & Co., Nationwide, Amazon, and Honda. Landlord-friendly regulations. Ohio ranks ninth out of all fifty U.S. states for being the most landlord-friendly.

Rental yield measures a property’s return by comparing its rental income to its market value ( annual rent/property value = rental yield ). Columbus has a relatively strong rental yield of 6.6% based on an average 3-bedroom single-family home rent of $1,738 and a median home value of $315,000. Higher education opportunities.

Rental demand looks like it will hold strong, too. Although rental prices have begun to stabilize, rates will likely keep rising this year thanks to a housing shortage and high mortgage rates. 8. Toledo, OH Toledo may be a great place to invest in real estate if you’re just getting started since the median home price in November 2022 was only $161,000. You may also see some fast-paced appreciation as home sales will likely grow by 4.2% and prices by 6.7% in 2023. This year, Toledo expects exciting new developments , such as building new apartments in the historic area to attract higher-income tenants. The city’s recent $67.5 million renovation project at the Glass City Center should also attract more visitors and boost the local economy. 9. Knoxville, TN Fox News listed Knoxville as one of the top real estate markets as the city’s population experienced its greatest growth since 2007 . This is no surprise, though, considering Knoxville’s housing inventory started to improve last year, and its job market remains strong. The city’s median home price is $331,100 , but rental rates and home prices are both expected to rise this year by around 4%. 10. Huntsville, AL Huntsville also appeared on the list of top markets, and for good reason. With a median home price of $327,500 , Rocket City is one of the most affordable markets that are still well populated right now. Not to mention, jobs and population are both on the rise there.

Several US cities are expected to offer excellent investment opportunities this year due to job growth, increased rental demand, and several other factors. Curious about which areas you should keep an eye on? In this article, we’ll cover 10 of the best cities for investors in 2023 and why these cities made the list. Table of Contents Austin, TX Hartford, CT El Paso, TX Phoenix, AZ Buffalo, NY Tampa, FL Columbia, SC Toledo, OH Knoxville, TN Huntsville, AL 1. Austin, TX Austin’s housing inventory is expected to increase this year, which may help keep home prices and buyer competition relatively low compared to other markets. Even though rental rate growth has recently begun to cool, rent was still up 24.7% in December 2022 compared to late 2019. These factors—along with a healthy job market—make Austin a good city to keep on your radar for investing in 2023. 2. Hartford, CT Hartford, CT, is expected to be one of the top markets for 2023 , with home prices set to grow by 8.5% and sales to increase by 6.5%. The other good news is that rent is on the rise in Hartford, with the average rent reaching $1,472 by the end of 2022. Some local renters may be concerned about affordability, but economists expect Hartford to attract out-of-state buyers and renters who can afford higher housing expenses. 3. El Paso, TX El Paso is the second-best Texas city on our list, as home sales are expected to grow by 8.9% and prices by 5.4%. Rental rates have continued to increase, with apartment rates up 10.6% since last year. Since housing is still relatively affordable in El Paso, local analysts say the city is attracting remote workers from higher-income areas. They also expect the local job market to expand as companies like Amazon and TJ Maxx bring better-paying hourly jobs. 4. Phoenix, AZ Phoenix’s strong economy makes it a top contender for great places to invest in 2023. Arizona as a whole ranked fourth last year for job market growth, and Phoenix specifically saw median earnings rise by 5.7%. The city’s housing market shows positive signs, too. By September 2022, available listings had grown by 257% , giving investors more room to negotiate and find a great deal. 5. Buffalo, NY Buffalo is another one of the more affordable markets, with a median home price of only $240,000 in 2022. As sellers lower their asking prices , sales are expected to rise by 6.3% this year. The city’s job market growth and low unemployment rate also make it an attractive place to invest in 2023. Matthew Roland, assistant dean and clinical assistant professor at the University at Buffalo, says the city’s economy is shifting from manufacturing to education and medical, which means household income may grow. 6. Tampa, FL Tampa home prices have increased by almost 18% compared to the nationwide average of 11%, yet the market still can’t keep up with demand as more people move into the area. Local leaders expect Hillsborough County’s population to grow from 1.5 million to 1.6 million by 2026—a good sign for long-term market growth and home appreciation. With a median home sale price of $364,990 in late 2022, Tampa is one of the more costly places to invest. But its steady population growth and rental demand make it a strong option for real estate investing. 7. Columbia, SC The median single-family home price in Columbia was around $250,000 in December 2022. But prices are expected to keep rising as retirees and remote workers continue moving to the area. Sales are expected to increase by 7.7% in 2023, and home prices to follow suit by 3.6%. Rental demand looks like it will hold strong, too. Although rental prices have begun to stabilize, rates will likely keep rising this year thanks to a housing shortage and high mortgage rates. 8. Toledo, OH Toledo may be a great place to invest in real estate if you’re just getting started since the median home price in November 2022 was only $161,000. You may also see some fast-paced appreciation as home sales will likely grow by 4. source_name: prop recordTitle: 10 Best Cities to Invest in Real Estate in 2023 recordUrl: https://www.propstream.com/real-estate-investor-blog/10-best-cities-to-invest-in-real-estate-in-2023 sys_file_type: html chunk_id: chk-7 \n Content: Feeling the pressure of today’s real estate market?

Tiny Homes Vs. Guest Houses: What’s the Difference? Disclaimer : PropStream doesn’t offer advice on adding ADUs, tiny homes, or guest houses to your property or renting them out. We recommend researching local zoning laws and working with a legal professional before investing in them. With home affordability the worst it’s been since 1984 , alternative housing options like accessory dwelling units (ADUs) and tiny homes are becoming increasingly popular. A recent Freddie Mac consumer survey found that after learning what an ADU is, 32% of respondents who don’t own one expressed interest in having one in the future. Similarly, an IDX1031 survey found that 56% of Americans would consider living in a tiny home, and 86% of those who’ve never owned a home said they’d consider buying one as their first property. As an investor or agent, you can capitalize on these trends. But first, you must understand the differences between ADUs, tiny homes, and guest houses. Though often used interchangeably, they mean different things. Key Takeaways: 🔑 It's crucial for real estate professionals to distinguish between Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs), tiny homes, and guest houses. While often used interchangeably, they serve different purposes and may have different regulations. 🔑 Before considering the addition of ADUs, tiny homes, or guest houses, it's essential to understand the regulatory landscape. Local zoning laws and permitting processes play a crucial role in determining the feasibility of these housing options. 🔑 Evaluating the cost and potential return on investment (ROI) is a critical factor in deciding whether to invest in ADUs, tiny homes, or guest houses. 🔑 The demand for ADUs, tiny homes, and guest houses is on the rise, fueled by factors such as a housing shortage, multi-generational living trends, and increased remote work. What Is an ADU? An accessory dwelling unit (ADU) is a secondary housing unit that shares a lot with another primary property. It’s a fixed structure with its own entrance, bathroom, and kitchen—everything a resident needs to live independently from the main home. There are three main ADU types: attached, detached, and internal. Attached An attached ADU (AADU) is structurally connected to the main home. For example, it may be an apartment built onto the back or side of the house. Detached A detached ADU (DADU) is a separate structure from the main home, such as a backyard cottage or a detached garage. Internal An internal ADU (IADU) is an ADU that exists entirely within the primary structure. A section of the interior space is converted into its own living space with a separate entrance. ADUs can serve as long- or short-term rentals, guest housing, home offices, housing for elderly parents or adult children, and more. They’re the most versatile alternative housing structure. What Is a Tiny Home? A tiny home is a residence that is significantly smaller than a traditional house—usually 100 to 400 square feet. Unlike ADUs, tiny homes don’t have to share a lot with another property and are generally portable, i.e., they lack a foundation and have wheels. Though they can be used similarly to ADUs (depending on the state), tiny homes are best suited for housing one or two residents due to their small size. What Is a Guest House? A guest house is a small dwelling on a single-family property meant for short-term visitors. Unlike ADUs and tiny homes, guest houses can’t provide permanent housing. They’re just a private space for family and friends to spend the night comfortably. Most guest houses have a bedroom with a half or three-quarters bathroom and no kitchen, relying on the primary home for cooking and other amenities. How are ADUs, Tiny Homes, and Guest Houses Regulated? Now that you know the main differences between ADUs, tiny homes, and guest houses, let’s review how they are regulated. ADU Regulations ADU regulations vary by state and city. In California, for example, they’ve been legal since 1982. However, at the time, many local governments implemented barriers to building them. Since then, the state has passed laws preventing cities from hindering ADU construction, leading to a 1,421% increase in California ADU permits from 2016 to 2021. Other states don’t allow AD source_name: prop recordTitle: ADUs Vs. Tiny Homes Vs.

Disclaimer : PropStream does not offer financial advice. We recommend consulting a financial professional and performing thorough research before making an investment decision based on current or future mortgage interest rates. Since March 2022, the Federal Reserve has raised its Federal Funds Rate—which serves as a benchmark for all other interest rates—11 times to a 22-year high . Average mortgage rates have followed suit, topping 8% for the first time since 2000. However, buyer activity has started to slow, with home sales hitting a 13-year low in September. As a real estate pro, it’s important to understand how mortgage interest rates affect the housing market so you can make more informed business decisions. Key Takeaways: 🔑 Fluctuations in mortgage interest rates significantly impact home affordability for buyers. A seemingly modest increase in interest rates can substantially raise monthly payments, potentially affecting buyers' ability to qualify for loans. 🔑 Mortgage rates influence buyer behavior, with rising rates often leading to a decline in buyer demand. Homeownership becomes more expensive, discouraging potential buyers. 🔑 Understanding the factors influencing mortgage rates, primarily the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, is crucial for anticipating market trends. The Impact of Mortgage Rates on Home Affordability Considering that 80% of homebuyers (and 97% of first-time homebuyers ) finance their home purchase, changes in mortgage interest rates can have a dramatic impact on home affordability. Consider the following: A $500,000 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at a 3% interest rate would have a monthly mortgage payment of $2,108. The same mortgage at a 7% interest rate would have a monthly payment of $3,327. That’s an extra $1,219 monthly and $438,840 over the 30-year loan term—nearly the original loan amount. Keep in mind that most traditional lenders want homebuyers to pay no more than a third of their gross income on housing. So, a homebuyer earning $100,000 per year could theoretically get approved for the $500,000 mortgage at 3% (assuming they meet the other creditworthiness requirements). However, the buyer would unlikely qualify for the same mortgage at 7%. This is a problem today, as the average US salary is around $60,575 , and the average cost of a home today is over $400,000. How Mortgage Rates Change Buyer Behavior Since mortgage rates impact home affordability, they, in turn, impact buyer activity. Buyer Demand When mortgage rates rise, and home ownership becomes more expensive, buyer demand tends to decline. When mortgage rates fall and homeownership becomes more affordable, buyer demand tends to pick up. This explains why mortgage applications are declining: Higher mortgage rates discourage homebuying. According to the Mortgage Banker Association, mortgage application activity recently fell to its lowest since 1995 . Similarly, existing home sales fell to a 13-year low of 3.96 million in September . Even though 7-8% mortgage rates are relatively normal compared to historical averages , many homebuyers have become accustomed to the low 3-4% rates of the past 15 years . Plus, the average cost for a home in the United States is about 642% higher than when interest rates were at their height in 1981, at 16.35% ($64,600 in 1981 compared to $479,500 in 2022). Although the interest rates were nearly double in 1981, the increase in median home prices compared to the rise in salary for the average American household ( $22,390 in 1981 vs. $74,580 in 2022 ; app. A 233% increase) has made the 7-8% interest rate have a more significant impact on home affordability in the modern day. Refinancing Activity Mortgage rates also affect refinancing activity. Refinancing replaces an existing loan with a new one, usually under better terms. For example, a homeowner may want to refinance their outstanding mortgage debt if interest rates fall. Why? Because doing so could lower their monthly payment and the loan’s final cost. Additionally, a cash-out refinance could let them withdraw equity from the property to put toward home renovations or other financial needs. When mortgage rates fall, demand for refinancing tends to rise. When mortgage rates rise, demand for refinancing tends to decrease. Currently, the mortgage refinancing industry is relatively inactive. In Q1 2023, refinancing originations amounted to $47 billion, down over 90% from Q1 2021 . The reason is simple: Fewer homeowners source_name: prop recordTitle: How Do Mortgage Interest Rates Impact Buyer Activity? recordUrl: https://www.propstream.com/news/how-do-mortgage-interest-rates-impact-buyer-activity sys_file_type: html chunk_id: chk-9 \n Content: Feeling the pressure of today’s real estate market?

Real estate investing is becoming an increasingly appealing career option for people who want to be their own boss, have endless earning potential, and build generational wealth. That being said, high housing costs can be a barrier for many aspiring investors. But what if it didn’t have to? Whether you’re interested in wholesaling, flipping, or buying and holding real estate, there are plenty of funding options to help you secure an investment property. Since so many options are available, it can be daunting to start learning what funding sources are available to you depending on your credit, borrowing history, or income. This is why we broke down what loans are available for the different types of real estate investors and the qualifications for each. Keep reading to learn more. Table of Contents Loan Types for Wholesalers Transactional Loan Loan Types for Flippers Fix and Flip Loan Renovation or Personal Loan Loan Types for Buy and Hold Investors Conventional Loan FHA Loan VA Loan Blanket Mortgage Portfolio HELOC or Home Equity Loan Seller Carryback Subject To Disclaimer: This article is intended for information purposes. Before applying for a loan or financial assistance, please get advice from a financial professional to determine if a financing option is right for your situation and determine your tax and legal responsibilities. Loan Types for Wholesalers In most wholesale transactions, the wholesaler will assign the contract rather than sell the property themselves. In this type of transaction, the wholesaler (in most cases) never technically owns the property. Because this is the easiest and least complex option for a wholesaler, assigning contracts is the ideal method of closing a wholesale deal. However, in some contracts, the seller does not permit the wholesaler to sell the contract. Instead, the wholesaler must purchase the property for a very short period (typically 1-3 days) before selling it to the buyer they’ve found. In this situation, a wholesaler will need a transactional loan. Transactional Loan A transactional loan is a short-term loan that allows wholesalers to close a deal without tying up their own assets in the transaction. With a transactional loan, the wholesaler will use it to purchase a property before turning around and selling it to their buyer. Transactional funding for wholesalers is beneficial because it typically doesn’t require a certain percentage down, a credit check, or proof of employment. As long as the deal is strong, a transactional lender will likely provide wholesalers with the short-term funds they need to close their next deal. Loan Types for Flippers For flippers, securing a funding source that will cover both the property purchase and renovations is important. Many beginners don’t have enough cash for a down payment and to pay for labor, materials, etc. There are a few different types of loans flippers can lean on, depending on their circumstances: Fix and Flip Loan A fix and flip loan is a form of short-term financing that enables flippers to finance both the property they want to flip and the necessary renovations. Also known as a “rehab loan,” a fix and flip loan is a subset of a category of loans known as “bridge loans.” While fix and flip loans have higher interest rates, investors can typically pay them off once they’ve sold their flip. Additionally, these loans often have more flexible terms than conventional loans, and the flipper may be able to access the funds sooner. To receive the necessary funds for your flip, your lender will typically use the ARV (after repair value) of a potential flip to determine how much they can lend. This ensures they aren’t losing money on the deal. Pro tip: When financing a fix and flip property, you may find it helpful to follow the 70% rule. The 70% rule means you shouldn’t pay more than 70% of the ARV after subtracting the renovation costs to profit from the flip. Example (feel free to plug your own numbers into this table to calculate): Renovation or Personal Loan Some fix and flip investors like to perform “live-in flipping.” With live-in flipping, an investor will make the house they’re flipping their primary residence, often selling for a higher profit after about two years. Once they sell the live-in flip, they will repeat the process. Eventually, this method may help investors save the funds they need to begin purchasing separate properties to flip, eliminating the need to move every couple of source_name: prop recordTitle: Financing for Real Estate Investors: What Are Your Options? recordUrl: https://www.propstream.com/real-estate-investor-blog/financing-for-real-estate-investors-what-are-your-options sys_file_type: html chunk_id: chk-10 \n Content:  strategy to work with current mortgage rates and the resulting buyer behavior patterns if you want to continue growing your business. In a high mortgage rate environment, real estate pros must get creative with where they find new leads, as high mortgage rates slow buyer activity. Pursuing motivated sellers in off-market properties can be the golden ticket. Life doesn’t stop just because the real estate market has changed, which means homeowners will always experience situations where they still need to sell and/or buy. PropStream It!

We recommend consulting with legal and/or financial professionals and doing your due diligence before investing in any properties. Many real estate investors start locally, but what if your market is too competitive, with high property values or strict regulations? Investing beyond your backyard—long-distance real estate investing—can be a smarter, more strategic move. Dive in to discover why and explore eight tips to succeed with this approach! Why Invest in Real Estate Long Distance? Investing in real estate long-distance can widen your investment prospects. For example, you may find markets with higher potential returns, better cash flow, or more landlord-friendly laws . Furthermore, long-distance real estate investing can help you diversify geographically. Instead of owning property in only one market, you can own property in multiple, minimizing your exposure to a downturn in any one. That said, long-distance real estate investing has its challenges. It may be harder to learn the market, find reliable contractors, and communicate across time zones. To mitigate these and other potential risks, follow these tips: 1. Research the Market Thoroughly Before you settle on a market to invest in, carefully study it. Learn its unique dynamics and trends so you can recognize a good deal when you see one. Here are some factors to consider: Property values Average rent Average vacancy rates Population growth Local employers Unemployment rates School ratings Crime rates Transportation options Overall, look for a market with a growing population, thriving economy, strong rental demand, low operating costs, and reasonable property prices. Of course, no market is perfect, but you might be surprised at the opportunities outside your local market. 2. Build a Reliable Local Team Once you’ve chosen a market, it’s time to build your team. This is extremely important when investing long-distance because you’re not there to manage properties in person. Your real estate team can include local agents, contractors, lawyers, lenders, insurance providers, property managers , and other investors. Each should serve a purpose—whether that’s managing your properties, executing renovations, facilitating transactions, or educating you on the market’s nuances and local regulations. Above all, your team members should be trustworthy. Ask your existing network for referrals, check online reviews, and look out for candidates with a strong reputation. 3. Leverage Technology Another must for managing properties from afar is technology. These days, there are many software options for streamlining everyday landlord tasks, such as rent collection, tenant screening, maintenance requests, and recordkeeping. There’s even virtual tour technology that lets you inspect and show properties remotely. Consider investing in some of these tools to automate repetitive tasks and free up time to find and analyze more real estate deals. 4. Communicate Regularly Clear and frequent communication is always important when managing real estate, especially when you’re far away from your tenants and team. Fortunately, there’s never been a better time to communicate long distance. With video calls, texts, and other digital channels, you can keep an open line of communication with tenants or outsource it to a property manager who can give you regular updates. Set a regular communication schedule with them so everyone stays on the same page. 5. Visit the Property Periodically Just because you’re an absentee landlord doesn’t mean you can’t visit your properties. Sometimes, visiting your investments to see them in person is worthwhile as it can provide a better sense of their value, condition, and needed maintenance. Of course, your property manager can handle this for you, too, but checking in helps keep them accountable. Plus, it can improve your relationships with tenants. Consider scheduling an annual visit to each of your properties to check in. 6. Establish Clear Processes and Protocols Without clear processes for managing properties remotely, your business may struggle. Set up systems for marketing rental units, screening tenants, collecting rent, responding to maintenance requests and emergencies, and more. Efficient standard operating procedures (SOPs) that comply with local regulations can help minimize errors and prevent important tasks from falling through the cracks. 7. Monitor Financial Performance Keep a close eye on your investments’ financial metrics. That way, if they no longer serve your goals or fail to perform, you can explore exit strategies. One easy way to track your rental income, property expenses, and ROI is to invest in accounting software. It can automatically calculate your returns and provide a dashboard to check investment performances source_name: prop recordTitle: 8 Tips for Long-Distance Real Estate Investing recordUrl: https://www.propstream.com/news/5-tips-for-long-distance-real-estate-investing sys_file_type: html chunk_id: chk-13 \n Content:  It’s no different from what a company like GEICO, for example, does with its ads all the time. They don't expect you to buy insurance after each commercial—whether it's a radio ad, a television ad, or a crossover ad with another company. Also, be sure to use a CRM to make notes as you reach out and follow up with people. Q: What mistakes do you often see real estate agents make when they’re reaching out to cold leads? They give up way too quickly. It can take up to six to 12 months before cold outreach begins to produce the fruit you want. It takes time to build an agent brand—maybe 17 to 25 touches. Each touch is a layer that gets you closer to your goal. I also see agents not doing enough calls to produce momentum. Not calling enough is like not pedaling a bicycle. If the bike's wheels aren’t turning fast enough, it will just fall down. You've got to keep the momentum up. Next, some agents don’t properly listen for cues. Here’s an example: somebody who is going to sell their house is not going to say, “Oh, we're thinking of selling. Come on over.” They’re going to say, “How is the market?” and ask similar questions. You have to listen for those cues and follow up on that interest. Q: What communication tips do you have for agents seeking to get clients through cold outreach? When first reaching out to a lead, I make it a point to speak a bit quickly and not start out asking, “How are you?” That will just result in a fast “Not interested.” Instead, I say, “ The purpose of my call is …” Short and to the point has always worked best for me with cold calling. Secondly—and this connects with my prior answer—I see some agents relying too much on scripts. Instead of reading straight from a script, they should say, “Hey, tell me about you,” and get them to talk a little bit or find a connection. I always try to be real and connect wherever there is an opening. For example, I was interacting with a lead whose last name was Cairo, and I said, “Funny, I’m in Chicago. Any relation to the Cairo Animal Hospital?” And he says, “No, but I lived in Chicago.” That allowed us to start talking, and then he said, “I don’t usually take calls from guys like you.” Later on, he called me back, and that wouldn’t have happened without finding that camaraderie quickly and listening to his cues. Q: What’s your final piece of advice for agents who want to start cold calling? Don’t give up! Remember, it takes six to 12 months to really see a difference. Also, make sure you always keep your appointments with leads, and don’t break them. Let PropStream Set You Up for Cold-Calling Success! Cold-calling can be an excellent way to reach out to prospects if you stay consistent, personable, and follow up with various other methods. However, to truly get the most out of cold-calling, you need an efficient way to find leads with the most motivation to work with you and a quick way to get their contact information. This is where PropStream comes in. PropStream does the work for you of finding lead motivation.

ADU Regulations ADU regulations vary by state and city. In California, for example, they’ve been legal since 1982. However, at the time, many local governments implemented barriers to building them. Since then, the state has passed laws preventing cities from hindering ADU construction, leading to a 1,421% increase in California ADU permits from 2016 to 2021. Other states don’t allow ADUs at all or have strict requirements regarding their size, occupancy limits, required parking space, and ability to be rented out. Keep in mind that once built, an ADU cannot be sold separately from the main property since it sits on the same lot. They must be sold together. Tiny Home Regulations Because tiny homes lack a foundation, they are usually not considered real estate but recreational vehicles (RVs). As such, they must be registered with the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and are subject to vehicle taxes instead of property taxes. Tiny homes also don’t meet most building codes and typically can’t be connected to the city grid except in designated areas such as mobile home parks. Some cities are more accepting of tiny homes than others. For example, Los Angeles has allowed them in backyards since 2019 . Other cities don’t, or if they do, require them to be accessible via driveway. Sometimes, you can rent out a tiny home if you own the land it sits on and it has all the necessary living amenities. Unlike ADUs, however, tiny homes can and must be sold separately from the main property since they are not physically attached. Guest House Regulations Guest houses are the most limited in their legal use. Unlike ADUs and tiny homes, they aren’t equipped with kitchens and consequently aren’t permitted for permanent residency or rental housing. Again, zoning restrictions vary by city. However, you may find them more lenient than those for ADUs and tiny homes since guest houses are for private use only. ❗Before constructing any of these alternative housing structures, consult a local attorney who specializes in the one you’re interested in and knows the relevant regulations. Also, investigate the permits needed within the county. Cost and Potential ROI of ADUs, Tiny Homes, and Guest Houses The cost and potential return on investment (ROI) of ADUs, tiny homes, and guest houses is another major factor to consider before investing in one. The average ADU costs between $150,000 and $400,000, depending on location, size, quality, and other factors. It’s generally the most expensive of the three housing types, but it also has the highest potential ROI. According to a Porch study , ADUs in big cities can increase your property’s value by up to 35%! In contrast, tiny homes typically only cost $30,000 to $60,000 because they are smaller and don’t require a foundation. Keep in mind, however, that since they are not attached to land (which tends to appreciate in value over time), tiny homes tend to depreciate the way vehicles do. Guest houses cost an average of $55,000 . Because they are fixed to the primary property, they tend to appreciate over time, potentially providing a positive ROI. However, you won’t benefit from steady rental income since guest houses can’t be rented out. The Growing Demand for ADUs, Tiny Homes, and Guest Houses Demand for ADUs, tiny homes, and guest houses is rising, not least because the U.S. is experiencing a record housing shortage. These smaller residential units can help fill the gap of 6.5 million missing homes . Additionally, multi-generational living is becoming more common. According to the Pew Research Center , the number of U.S. young adults who live with their parents is at an all-time high for the first time since the Great Depression. Similarly, many Americans without retirement savings choose to move in with their adult children . Furthermore, increased remote work has boosted demand for office ADUs. According to the U.S. Census Bureau , the number of people primarily working from home tripled between 2019 and 2021. Loosening regulations are also contributing to a growing demand for smaller residential units. In October, the U.S. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced new policies that let lenders count ADU rental income when underwriting mortgages. Similarly, California has set aside a budget of $50 million to pay some homeowners to build ADUs. Now may be as good a time as any to invest in an ADU, tiny home, or guest house. Just be sure to check local regulations, get the proper permits, and work with a professional. Share Published by PropStream November 27, 2023  source_name: prop recordTitle: ADUs Vs. Tiny Homes Vs.
