# Contact Center AI - API Rate Limits 

Contact Center AI enforces rate limits to restrict the number of API requests an account/application can make within a timeframe. It helps prevent a single user or service from consuming disproportionate resources that could degrade the service for others.

Requests are monitored against a sixty-second limit. As long as the limit is not exceeded, the account/application can continue making requests.

When the rate limit is exceeded, subsequent requests will fail with the following error message:

“*You've exceeded the per-minute rate limit. Please wait for sometime before retrying*.”

## Best Practices

* Spread out calls evenly to avoid traffic spikes.
* Use filters to limit the data response size and avoid calls that request overlapping data.
* When the limit has been reached, stop making API calls. Wait for the specific time period to pass. Alternatively, implement a backoff strategy where your application automatically reduces its request frequency and retries failed requests after a calculated delay.
