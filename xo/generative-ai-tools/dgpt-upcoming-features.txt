The implementation of DialogGPT is planned in the following phases:

* Phase 1 (included in v11.8): Focuses on core capabilities like the main DialogGPT flow, RAG pipeline, conversation orchestrator, and handling of common conversation intents.
* Phase 2 (included in v11.14): Introduces advanced features such as Dynamic Routing support, granular intent identification, batch testing, and support for new XO GPT models and commercial models.
* Phase 3 (future release): Includes extended capabilities like multilingual support, custom entity extraction, and implementation of guardrails.
