# Intro to New Admin Console

The Admin Console is where AI agents project administrators can manage AI for Service assistants and related tasks, users, security, billing, and more, at an organization level. This article provides an overview of the Admin Console, taking you through prerequisites, access options, and a recommended workflow.

## Admin Prerequisites

To sign up for an Admin account, you must meet the following requirements:

* A valid email address.
* A validated Kore.ai user account. If you do not have a user account, Kore.ai will create a user account for you, and you must validate that account before proceeding.
* Authorization to control the Admin account. Only one user in an account can be the primary Admin. The Primary Admin can add multiple other users as admins with custom-defined permissions.

## Accessing the Admin Console

You can access the Admin Console from the [AI for Service Platform](https://platform.kore.ai/builder){:target="_blank"} using the **Go To Admin Console** option, under your user account menu.

You can also access the Admin Console by going directly to: [https://platform.kore.ai/Admin](https://platform.kore.ai/Admin) 

!!! Note

    These options are available only for the AI for Service account Administrator.  

In case you have access to multiple accounts, the same will be listed for selection.  You can set one as the default account.

The  Platform offers an additional layer of security beyond username and password during account sign-in with **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**. 2FA, when enabled, prompts for a security code verification after you’ve entered your username and password. [Learn more](./security-and-control/two-factor-authentication-for-platform-access.md#enable-two-factor-authentication){:target="_blank"}.

AI for Service triggers a session timeout after 15 minutes of idle time to prevent unauthorized access. In such scenarios, you will be taken to your account admin console and asked to sign in again.

As an Admin, you can enroll users, manage admin and custom roles, define security settings, and manage AI agents in your company. The following illustration is an example of the Admin Console with the **Dashboard** page displayed. [Refer here for more on the Admin Dashboard](dashboard-bac.md){:target="_blank"}.

## Getting Started as an Admin

When you first start using the AI for Service, using the Admin Console, you should start inviting and adding users to join the AI for Service account for your company.

You can also control access to individual assistants in your enterprise account. For managing access to assistants, [see here](bot-management.md){:target="_blank"}.

If your enterprise has varied departments, with each having individual and separate assistant requirements, it's advisable to segregate the development into Groups. You can create groups of users and assign assistants to the groups as needed. For managing groups, [see here](./user-management/managing-your-groups.md){:target="_blank"}.

!!! Note

    _The role of App Owner is assigned at the time of App creation and can be changed either from the App Management module or from the Platform by the App Owner, not from Role Management._
