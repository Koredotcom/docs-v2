* **Test** and **save**     the fields to apply the field mapping for ingestion. 


## Advanced Content Extraction and Processing


### [Flexible Extraction Framework](https://docs.kore.ai/xo/searchai/content-extraction/extraction/)

Search AI introduces a **customizable extraction strategy framework** that adapts to different document types, replacing SearchAssist's static one-size-fits-all approach.



* [Image-based Document Extraction -](https://docs.kore.ai/xo/searchai/content-extraction/extraction/#image-based-document-extraction) Capture the semantic meaning between textual and image content through **VDR-based embeddings**, enabling greater accuracy for complex documents containing nontextual layouts such as tables or forms. By interpreting the visual structure alongside the text, Search AI ensures more reliable indexing from complex document structures. 
* [Markdown Extraction -](https://docs.kore.ai/xo/searchai/content-extraction/extraction/#markdown-extraction) Transforms each page of a document into structured Markdown format before further processing. This strategy is particularly effective in preserving the semantic structure of the original content.
* [Layout Aware Extraction -](https://docs.kore.ai/xo/searchai/content-extraction/extraction/#layout-aware-extraction) Identifies objects in documents by combining OCR technology, layout detection models, and layout awareness rules. This approach enhances Search AI's ability to comprehend tables, graphs, and charts in documents and generate answers based on this information.
* [Advanced HTML Extraction - ](https://docs.kore.ai/xo/searchai/content-extraction/extraction/#advanced-html-extraction) Intelligent processing of images and tables from HTML documents
* [Custom Extraction -](https://docs.kore.ai/xo/searchai/content-extraction/extraction/#custom-extraction) Allows enterprises to modify the search data pipeline by inserting their custom extraction logic.

### Multimodal Content Support

Search AI supports the extraction and processing of diverse content types, including text, tables, images, and layout-based visual structures, using different extraction techniques. Users can define different extraction strategies for different types of content. This multimodal capability ensures efficient extraction for different types of content. 


### [Custom Content Transformation During Extraction ](https://docs.kore.ai/xo/searchai/content-extraction/transformation/)

The content transformation layer used to enrich content immediately after extraction and before vectorization now features an **additional API stage** for custom processing of the extracted content. This allows developers to make custom changes to the content while preserving essential relationships and context of the original document. Additionally, developers can now define enrichment logic using **JavaScript**, replacing the earlier use of painless scripts. This change makes the enrichment process more developer-friendly and easier to maintain.


### [Chunk-Level Processing](https://docs.kore.ai/xo/searchai/workbench/introduction/)

**Chunk Workbench** provides granular control over how content is transformed at the individual chunk level. This flexibility enables teams to tailor data processing to meet specific business needs, such as appending page summaries to each chunk for enhanced context and improved performance.


### Multi-Vector Generation

Search AI supports multi-vector search, which allows you to associate multiple embedding vectors with a single chunk of data. This advanced technique significantly improves retrieval accuracy by capturing different important fields of a chunk. Each vector can be assigned a weightage based on the relative importance of the fields used in that vector generation, enabling the system to prioritize certain fields during search and retrieval. This leads to more relevant and accurate results.


### [Enhanced Embedding Models](https://docs.kore.ai/xo/searchai/index-configuration/)

Search AI supports advanced embedding models to improve semantic understanding across both structured and unstructured content types.

* Support for **E5 and VDR(Image Embeddings) embedding models** for superior semantic understanding across text and image data.
* **Custom embedding support** without requiring middleware.


## Gen AI Capabilities

* [Custom LLM support](https://docs.kore.ai/xo/generative-ai-tools/models-library/#custom-llm-integration-framework) for answer generation without requiring middleware
* [Dynamic Models and Prompts for answers](https://docs.kore.ai/xo/apis/searchai/advance-search/) - Support for runtime selection of prompts and LLM models within the answer generation API, allowing developers to tailor responses dynamically based on query intent, user context, or application requirements.
