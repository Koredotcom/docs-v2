# Digital Skills

 Improving the user experience is a crucial aspect of developing a AI Agent or any digital application. Digital skills are essential for efficiently handling and presenting information to users in a user-friendly and visually appealing manner.

## What are Digital Skills?

Digital Skills are a set of features within the Platform which allow you to create interactive user interfaces that can either retrieve or present information to/from the user. These interfaces take the shape of either of the following:

* **Digital Forms**: These allow you to retrieve information from end users by showing them a form rather than configuring the AI Agent to ask them for each piece of information individually.

* **Digital Views**: There are two components to Digital Views:
     * **Widgets**: These can be set up to retrieve information from a Dialog Task, JSON file or Digital Form and present it to the user.
     * **Panels**: A Panel is a collection of widgets. You can use Panels to present end users with the same type of information in an organized manner in one place. For example, you might have a *My Trips* Panel, which could include widgets for *Upcoming Trips*, *Completed Trips* and *Canceled Trips*.

## Digital Skills Implementation

* You can implement Digital Forms within the Platform, with the information [here](../../../automation/use-cases/digital-skills/digital-forms.md){:target="_blank"}. 

* You can also implement Digital Views by following the process described [here](../../../automation/use-cases/digital-skills/digital-views.md){:target="_blank"}. 

* Digital Views can be further enhanced using the Widget SDK, which you can learn more about [here](../../../app-settings/dev-tools/kore-ai-web-sdk.md){:target="_blank"}.

* You can download the Widget SDK from <a href="https://github.com/Koredotcom/web-kore-sdk" target="_blank">Kore.ai’s GitHub profile</a>.
