# Dialog Tasks Overview

Dialog Tasks is an essential tool in building conversations connected to your business logic.

Each task comprises interlinked [nodes ](./node-types/nodes-transitions.md){:target="_blank"}that help retrieve information, perform actions, connect with external apps, send messages to users, and more.

To learn more and start creating your own Dialog Tasks, first learn how to [Navigate the Dialog Builder](navigating-dialog-tasks.md){:target="_blank"} and then how to [Work with Dialog Tasks](using-the-dialog-builder-tool.md){:target="_blank"}.

While working with Dialog Tasks, you will be interacting with a variety of related features, including:

* [Sub-intent management & Node Grouping ](./node-connections/grouping-nodes.md){:target="_blank"}– You can configure sub-intents within a task using group nodes or configure a task as a subintent.
* [Component Transitions ](./node-types/nodes-transitions.md#component-transitions){:target="_blank"}– Each node can be configured to connect to other nodes according to specific if-else conditions that you can customize based on various criteria.
* [Voice and IVR integration](./node-types/voice-call-properties.md){:target="_blank"} – Relevant nodes can be integrated with voice and IVR tools to assist your users via voice.
* [User and Error Prompt management](prompt-editor.md){:target="_blank"} – Task nodes allow you to customize the messaging users see when interacting with that node or when there is an error.
* [The Context Object ](../../intelligence/context-object.md){:target="_blank"}– You can use the Context Object as a container for data that can be used across tasks, intents, and FAQs.
