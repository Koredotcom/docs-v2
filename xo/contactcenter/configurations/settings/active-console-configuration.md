# Active Console Configuration

Active Console Configuration ensures seamless management of agent sessions when the console is open in multiple tabs, devices, or browsers. It prompts agents to transfer the active session to the new tab or device and blocks concurrent use until they confirm the transfer. The feature maintains session continuity, establishes new connections as needed, and logs all transfer actions in audit reports.
