# Obscure Customer Info in Analytics - Interactions

Administrators can configure the system to hide customer Email IDs and Phone Numbers in the Interactions dashboard, Details slider, and Export file. Instead, the system displays the internal User ID.

Steps to enable Obscure Customer Info in Analytics - Interactions:

1. Navigate to Contact Center AI > Configurations > Settings > System Settings > Obscure Customer Info in Analytics - Interactions.

* **Replace Customer Column with User ID in export file**: Turn on the toggle to display the User ID instead of Email ID or Phone Number in the Customer column of the Interactions export file.
