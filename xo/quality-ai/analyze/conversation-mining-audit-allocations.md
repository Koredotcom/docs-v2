# Audit Allocations Overview

Audit Allocations streamlines the manual quality assurance workflow by enabling QA managers and supervisors to systematically assign interactions to auditors for evaluation. This feature addresses the critical need for manual oversight in automated quality assurance systems, allowing teams to validate Auto QA accuracy, provide targeted agent feedback, and maintain consistent quality standards across all customer interactions.

The Audit Allocations interface adapts to your permission level, displaying either management or auditor views based on your role.

## Why Audit Allocations?

Even with robust Auto QA systems, contact centers rely on manual evaluations to improve accuracy and deliver meaningful agent coaching. Traditional audit allocation methods create several operational challenges, which Audit Allocations directly addresses.

* **Allocation Visibility Gaps**: Tracking which interactions you've assigned to auditors and monitoring completion progress across your team.

* **Inflexible Assignment Management**: Reassigning interactions when auditors become unavailable due to leave, workload changes, or scheduling conflicts.

* **Manual Workflow Inefficiencies**: Creating custom allocations without pre-saved filters, requiring multiple steps to set up one-time audit assignments.

* **Limited Control Over Distribution**: Managing per-agent interaction volumes limits consistent evaluation coverage across the team.

* **Organizational Confusion**: Distinguishing between conversation analysis (Conversation Mining) and audit assignment workflows when they share the same interface.

Audit Allocations transforms the manual QA assignment process by providing a dedicated workspace with complete visibility into allocation lifecycle management, flexible reassignment capabilities, and streamlined allocation creation.

## How Does Audit Allocations Help?

Audit Allocations delivers value through several key capabilities that enhance your manual QA workflow:

* **Comprehensive Tracking**: Monitor all allocations you've created with real-time visibility into auditor-wise completion rates, enabling proactive workload management.

* **Flexible Reassignment**: Redistribute pending interactions from unavailable auditors to other team members, ensuring consistent evaluation coverage without workflow disruption.

* **Streamlined Allocation Creation**: Create custom allocations with quick filters directly in the assignment workflow, eliminating the need to pre-save filters for one-time audits.

* **Controlled Distribution**: Specify exact interaction counts or percentages per agent, giving you precise control over evaluation workload across your auditor team.

* **Dual Assignment Methods**: Choose between random sampling for unbiased coverage or custom filters for targeted evaluations based on specific criteria.
