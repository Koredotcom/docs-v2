# Agent Dashboard - Supervisor Evaluation

This allows supervisors to drill down into language-specific evaluation data and view specific agents' interactions and the details of evaluations performed in the last selected time period. Supervisors can use these interactions as reference points for coaching to help agents enhance their performance. Based on the reviewed interactions and created bookmarks, supervisors can assign targeted coaching assignments to the agents. This displays the list of interactions of the agent, with the most recent ones appearing first.

### Filter Options

The agent dashboard filters interaction data to show only evaluations performed in the selected languages. This allows you to refine the displayed data based on the selected language and date range. 

### Evaluation

This Evaluation section has the following interactions listing items:

* **Date**: This displays the date and time that an interaction has started.

* **Actions (Bookmark Interaction)**: This displays the list of bookmarks assigned to an interaction, which you can filter and assign coaching for later reference.

* **Queues**: This displays the completed queue interaction and its origin.

* **Kore Evaluation Score**: This displays the Kore Evaluation score (Auto QA Score) for the interaction based on the relevant evaluation form.

* **Supervisor Audit Score**: This displays the Supervisor Audit score if the interaction has already been audited or manually evaluated.

* **Sentiment Score**: This displays the system-generated sentiment score for the interaction based on the context of what the customer said in the interaction (keywords and emotions about that topic).

* **Date Range Selection**: This allows you to filter the date range options for agent conversation interactions, with the default setting always displaying the last 7 days.

* **Bookmarks**: Allows you to filter the saved bookmark interactions that an agent has handled. This filters only the specific agent's interactions that have been bookmarked for coaching by the supervisor and need to be audited properly. This populates only the bookmarks that are audited in the agent dashboard.

* **Filters**: Allows you to filter the interactions that are already audited based on specific agents for a selected date range.

    The following filtered categories are:

    * **Queues**: Allows you to filter and apply interactions based on the queues.

    * **Audit Status**: This allows you to filter and apply audited and unaudited interactions separately.   

    * **Filter Interactions**: This displays the total number of filtered interactions.

### Create Coaching or Add Coaching Assignment

Supervisors can initiate coaching sessions for agents by selecting one or more interactions where the agent's performance was below expectations. This feature allows the supervisor to identify specific interactions that highlight areas needing improvement, enabling focused coaching. By choosing multiple interactions, the supervisor can address recurring issues or trends, offering more comprehensive feedback that targets consistent performance gaps.

After selecting interactions, the supervisor can create a coaching session with feedback and clear steps to help the agent improve specific skills or behaviors. 

Steps to add coaching assignments:

1. By default, the following **Add Coaching Assignments** screen is displayed when you select any interactions.
