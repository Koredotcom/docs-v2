**Phase description:**

* **Customer Creation:** The case creation process begins when a customer contacts the service team with an issue or request. Customer service representatives capture and document all relevant information during this initial interaction.

* **Case Categorization:** Once a case is created, it moves into the categorization phase where the issue is analyzed and classified. Case managers and senior customer service staff review the documented information to determine the specific type of issue.

* **Case Assignment:** The assignment phase focuses on matching cases with the most appropriate personnel for resolution. Team leads and case managers consider multiple factors when making assignment decisions.

* **Investigation and Diagnosis:** The investigation and diagnosis phase represents the analytical core of the case management process. Assigned agents conduct thorough investigations to understand the root cause of the customer's issue.

* **Resolution:** The resolution phase transforms the diagnostic findings into concrete action to solve the customer's problem. Assigned agents execute the approved resolution plan following established procedures.

* **Customer Communication:** Effective customer communication serves as the bridge between internal case management activities and customer satisfaction. Representatives maintain regular contact with customers throughout the entire case lifecycle.

* **Case Closure:** The case closure process ensures that resolved cases are properly finalized and documented before archiving. Assigned agents verify that all resolution steps have been completed successfully.

* **Review and Analysis:** The review and analysis phase focuses on extracting valuable insights from completed cases to drive continuous improvement. Quality assurance teams and management regularly review closed cases.
